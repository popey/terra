These students were challenged to work on open source project briefs. Team 1 focused on non-code contributions, while Team 2’s brief was to create a unified documentation experience, giving them a chance to apply their design skills to real-world problems within the open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>We reached out to <a href=\"https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/design-creative-arts/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Loughborough University School of Design and Creative Arts</a> because there is a real need for non-code contributions in the open source ecosystem. Design thinking, which goes beyond the code to consider the user experience, is paramount if we want open source to thrive and gain ever more widespread adoption. Each team tackled a unique challenge that reflects the growing need for design thinking in open source, where developers have traditionally led, but where a better user experience is now urgently needed.</p>\n<p>This post celebrates their thoughtful work, sharing reflections from their design journey, and invites others to consider contributing to open source projects!</p>\n<p>Interested in checking out the project briefs yourself?

Tackling a real client brief helped us engage more deeply with the problem and understand its real-world context. Working with Canonical was particularly motivating, as it gave us the sense that our efforts were contributing to something genuinely impactful.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What surprised you most about open source?</h4>\n<p>As a team, we realised we hadn’t truly thought about the various barriers designers encounter when engaging with open source projects. We also found it fascinating that many designers are quite protective of their work, which makes open sharing a real challenge. It created a unique tension –everyone wanted to learn from others, but few felt comfortable giving their work away for free.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What design decision did your team focus on and why?</h4>\n<p>We used insights from our user research to guide our design direction, ensuring that each decision was grounded in evidence. Prototyping allowed us to test various design details and components, which helped us refine our approach and gain a much clearer sense of direction. As a team, we brought diverse backgrounds and skill sets—those with stronger design experience naturally took the lead in developing and refining the visual aspects of the project.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How has this experience influenced how you think about design and collaboration?</h4>\n<p>On reflection, there were many possible directions we could have taken, but in hindsight, grounding our decisions in user insights and continuous testing helped align the team around a clear vision. Regular client feedback was invaluable in refining our approach and ensuring we stayed true to user needs. Additionally, leveraging each team member’s strengths allowed us to work more efficiently and make the most of our diverse skills. Overall, it was a valuable experience that taught us how to collaborate rapidly and effectively to address a real-world brief.</p>\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Team 2: Unifying Juju’s documentation ecosystem</h1>\n<p>Project brief: Improve the accessibility, clarity, and cohesiveness of Juju’s documentation to enhance user experience and encourage adoption.<br/><br/>Objective: Reimagining how users discover and learn about Juju (Canonical’s open source application orchestration engine for the deployment, integration, and lifecycle management) by improving the documentation experience. </p>\n<p>Team members:<a href=\"https://sharvarirai.framer.website/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Sharvari Rai</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bavraj-virdi-120030254/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bavraj Virdi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinya-wang-79297b390/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Xinya Wang</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/siying-fan-324508368/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Siying Fan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/qingwan-yu-b138a8368/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qingwan</a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/qingwan-yu-b138a8368/\"> Yu<br/><br/></a>Check out their <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/deck/sl4Je3lBfLQIAHLTKVVJsK/Canonical?node-id=1-126&amp;viewport=-88%2C-46%2C0.52&amp;t=mKdUYsomHF7yzYyI-1&amp;scaling=min-zoom&amp;content-scaling=fixed&amp;page-id=0%3A1\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">project presentation</a>!</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reflection from the team</h2>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What were your first impressions about the problem space?</h4>\n<p>When we were first introduced to the project, our initial reaction was that the brief felt highly technical and complex, with unfamiliar terms like charms, operators, and Kubernetes. As none of us came from a technical or programming background, the documentation space felt like a challenge for us was the learning curve of diving in and understanding what is in the documentation and what it means. We struggled to identify a clear starting point and to understand the overall purpose of Juju beyond the jargon. Since the platform is mainly aimed at developers, it was difficult at first to relate to or imagine user needs. Despite that, this initial confusion actually helped us empathise with potential users facing similar barriers, and it highlighted the importance of clarity and structure in the documentation. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What was your approach to designing a more unified documentation experience?</h4>\n<p>Our approach began with breaking down the brief into simpler terms and mapping the current documentation ecosystem so we could better understand the challenges. As a team, we created personas for both new and experienced users, which helped us think about different entry points and the level of guidance each group might need. We then sketched user journeys to highlight pain points and challenges. From there, we focused on developing a single, structured information architecture with clearer pathways for learning and troubleshooting.  The aim was to allow users to move confidently between different sections without having to relearn how to navigate each time. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What were the biggest challenges your team encountered during the project?</h4>\n<p>The main challenge was the steep learning curve of immersing ourselves in the technical complexity of the Juju ecosystem and its vast open source documentation, especially since most of us came from non-technical backgrounds. We had to quickly grasp the product and its entire linked ecosystem. As direct access to real users was limited, we relied heavily on secondary data, community forums, and the creation of personas to accurately map realistic pain points. Our constant goal was to balance technical accuracy with the required user-centred clarity, which pushed us to fundamentally rethink how developer documentation can effectively guide users without overwhelming them. </p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What skills or takeaways are you bringing with you from this experience?</h4>\n<p>This project was a major lesson in how to embrace and navigate ambiguity. This was a truly crucial learning experience when dealing with an unfamiliar domain, evolving product documentation, and diverse stakeholder needs. We significantly strengthened our ability to translate dense technical research into clear, actionable design recommendations. We also honed our communication and collaboration skills as a team, successfully aligning our user-focused vision with Canonical’s roadmap. Most importantly, we learned that user advocacy is vital even in highly technical environments, and that our focus is ultimately on humanising complex systems.</p>\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">🎉Congratulations to both teams!</h1>\n<p>We would like to thank and congratulate both teams for their creativity, thoughtful research, and commitment to enhancing open source experiences through design. They approached complex, open-ended problems with maturity and curiosity, and their outcomes were both inspiring and practical. </p>\n<p>Their fresh perspectives also reminded us of the value of questioning assumptions and looking at familiar challenges through new eyes, reinforcing how much we as practitioners can learn from emerging designers.</p>\n<p>We hope these projects have not only added valuable work to their portfolios but also opened doors to future engagement with open source communities. We encourage them (and any other designer out there) to continue exploring open source, contributing through design, and helping shape more inclusive, user-friendly technologies!</p>\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interested in running a project like this?</h1>\n<p>Are you part of a university looking to bring open source design into your curriculum? <a href=\"https://canonical.design/blog/open-design-the-opportunity-design-students-didnt-know-they-were-missing\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">We’re looking for academic partners</a> who want to give students meaningful, real-world experiences while contributing to the global open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Reach out at <a href=\"mailto:opendesign@canonical.com\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">opendesign@canonical.com</a></p>\n<p>Learn more at <a href=\"https://canonical.design/blog/open-design-the-opportunity-design-students-didnt-know-they-were-missing\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Canonical.design</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Join the Canonical design team</strong></h3>\n<p>We’re looking for designers who care about craft and how systems work under the hood.

This is a significant escalation.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"context\">Context</h2>\n<p>Snaps are compressed, cryptographically signed, revertable software packages for Linux desktops, servers, and embedded devices. They use standard security primitives in the Linux kernel alongside technology developed by Canonical for Ubuntu.</p>\n<p>Snaps are published in the Canonical-run Snap Store. Anyone can sign up for an account and, with relatively few roadblocks, publish a confined application.

Exodus Scam BitCoin Wallet Snap!</a> - March 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I worked for Canonical between 2011 and 2021 as an Engineering Manager, Community Manager, and Developer Advocate. I was a strong advocate for snap packages and the Snap Store. While I left the company nearly five years ago, I still <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/publisher/popey\">maintain</a> nearly 50 packages in the Snap Store, with thousands of users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/popey-publisher-page.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/popey-publisher-page_50pc.png\" alt=\"popey&rsquo;s publisher page\"></a></p>\n<p>I also worked for <a href=\"https://anchore.com/\">Anchore</a> until September 2025, where they sponsor development of two open-source, Apache-licensed security tools: <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/syft\">Syft</a> (an SBOM generator) and <a href=\"https://github.com/anchore/grype/\">Grype</a> (a vulnerability scanner).</p>\n<p>I mention my employment history for transparency, and because knowledge from both roles informed this investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Personally, I want the Snap Store to be successful, and for users to be confident that the packages they install are trustworthy and safe.</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, that confidence isn&rsquo;t warranted, which is a problem for desktop Linux users who install snap packages.</p>\n<p><strong>I report every bad snap I encounter, and I know other security professionals do the same - even though doing so results in no action for days sometimes.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-snapscope\">Enter SnapScope</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/snapscope.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/snapscope_50pc.png\" alt=\"SnapScope\"></a></p>\n<p>I recently created <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/\">SnapScope</a> as part of a &ldquo;VibeCoding&rdquo; <a href=\"https://github.com/chainguard-demo/vibelympics\">contest</a> run by some friends at <a href=\"https://www.chainguard.dev/\">Chainguard</a>. They&rsquo;re good people doing great work - check them out.</p>\n<p>My original intention was to create a web app that generates an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for each snap using Syft, then produces a vulnerability report using Grype. Neither tool is perfect, and other tools exist, but I&rsquo;m familiar with these and they suited the contest nicely.</p>\n<p>While monitoring <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/\">SnapScope</a>, I was reminded of the malware problem. SnapScope wasn&rsquo;t <em>intended</em> to find malware - it was meant to identify outdated snaps with potential security issues. But I soon added features to highlight suspicious packages, so users could make informed decisions when searching for software.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/malware.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.popey.com/images/2026-01-17/malware_50pc.png\" alt=\"SnapScope\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>To be clear</strong>: none of this should be seen as an attack on the Snap Store, Canonical, or the engineers working on these problems. I&rsquo;m raising awareness of an issue that exists, because I want it fixed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-scam\">The Scam</h2>\n<p>The perpetrators - probably based in or near Croatia, based on data I&rsquo;ve been gathering - are constantly attempting to publish fake crypto wallet applications. The malware masquerades as genuine apps like Exodus, Ledger Live, or Trust Wallet. It asks users to enter their wallet recovery phrase, sends those credentials to the criminals, displays an error to the user, and by the time anyone realises what&rsquo;s happened, the wallet is empty.</p>\n<p>Whatever you think of cryptocurrency, these people are absolute dog shit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-cat-and-mouse-game\">The Cat-and-Mouse Game</h2>\n<p>The Canonical Snap Store admins have attempted to stem the flow. However, as with many security issues, it&rsquo;s a relentless game of whack-a-mole.</p>\n<p>The scammers have tried various approaches to appear legitimate:</p>\n<p><strong>Initially</strong>, they just published authentic-looking applications with plausible screenshots and storefront pages. This was the approach I documented in my previous articles about the fake &ldquo;Exodus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ledger Live&rdquo; apps.</p>\n<p><strong>Then</strong>, they started evading text filters by using similar-looking characters from other alphabets. For example, replacing the lowercase &ldquo;d&rdquo; in &ldquo;Ledger&rdquo; with the Armenian letter <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhe_(Armenian_letter)\">Zhe</a> &ldquo;ժ&rdquo;, which at first glance passes for a Latin &ldquo;d&rdquo;. They also use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palochka\">Palochka</a> &ldquo;ӏ&rdquo; which resembles a lowercase &ldquo;L&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><strong>More recently</strong>, they&rsquo;ve adopted a bait-and-switch approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Register an innocuous, unrelated snap name like <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/package/lemon-throw\">lemon-throw</a>, <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/package/alpha-hub\">alpha-hub</a>, or <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/package/tenor-freeze\">tenor-freeze</a></li>\n<li>Publish something harmless - often claiming to be a game</li>\n<li>Wait for approval</li>\n<li>Push a second revision containing the fake crypto wallet app</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some of us in the community diligently report these applications to Canonical, and after a period they get removed. But the sad fact is they keep getting through, and users could see, install, and be fooled by these malicious applications before anyone catches them. <a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/\">Déjà</a> <a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-follow-up/\">vu</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.popey.com/2024/03/exodus-wallet-part-three/\">much</a>?</p>\n<h2 id=\"following-the-telegram-trail\">Following the Telegram Trail</h2>\n<p>Every so often, I download these dodgy snaps (<code>snap download badsnap</code>), unpack them (<code>unsquashfs badsnap.snap</code>), and have a poke around. Frequently it&rsquo;s the same codebase republished under a new name. Sometimes they vary the language or framework, but almost always follow the same pattern: an app rendering a web page that looks like a legitimate crypto wallet.</p>\n<p>I discovered that when launched, the applications ping this URL:</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://togogeo.com/trust.php?name=8888-8888\">https://togogeo.com/trust.php?name=8888-8888</a></em></p>\n<p>This appears to be a connectivity test - if the victim has no internet connection or if <code>togogeo.com</code> is inaccessible, the application reports an error and refuses to continue. Makes sense from the scammers&rsquo; perspective: no point asking for credentials if you can&rsquo;t exfiltrate them.</p>\n<p>Initially, hitting this URL manually with <code>curl</code> returned something rather revealing:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\"><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>{\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;status&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;success&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;message&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Notification sent to Telegram: 8888-8888&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;telegram_response&#34;</span>: {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;ok&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">true</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;result&#34;</span>: {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;message_id&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">30111</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;from&#34;</span>: {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">7477383815</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;is_bot&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">true</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;first_name&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;SmartShieldBot&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;username&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;pandadrainerbot&#34;</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      },\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;chat&#34;</span>: {\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;id&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">5915612669</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;first_name&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;ezzcash&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;username&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;ikaikaika101&#34;</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;type&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;private&#34;</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      },\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;date&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1767464029</span>,\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>      <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;text&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;8888-8888&#34;</span>\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>    }\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>  }\n</span></span><span style=\"display:flex;\"><span>}\n</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Well, hello there <a href=\"https://t.me/ikaikaika101\">@ikaikaika101</a>.

By then, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>\n<h2 id=\"domain-squatting-the-new-low\">Domain Squatting: The New Low</h2>\n<p>Just when you thought they&rsquo;d run out of tricks, they&rsquo;ve found another way in - and this one&rsquo;s particularly nasty.</p>\n<p>Rather than registering new accounts and hoping to slip through the filters, they&rsquo;ve started monitoring the Snap Store for published applications whose publishers&rsquo; domain registrations have lapsed. Think about it: a snap published years ago by <code>somedev@coolproject.tech</code>, where <code>coolproject.tech</code> expired and wasn&rsquo;t renewed.</p>\n<p>The scammers swoop in, register the expired domain, trigger a password reset on the Snap Store account, and <em>boom</em> - they now control a legitimate, trusted publisher account with an established history. No new account scrutiny. No &ldquo;New Publisher&rdquo; flags. Just an existing, seemingly trustworthy snap that suddenly gets a new revision containing their wallet-draining malware.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve identified at least two domains this has happened with recently: <code>storewise.tech</code> and <code>vagueentertainment.com</code>. There are almost certainly more.</p>\n<p>This is a significant escalation. Previously, users could at least be wary of newly published snaps from fresh accounts. Now? That snap you installed three years ago from a reputable-looking publisher could push a malicious update tomorrow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-now\">What Now?</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not writing this to bury snaps or the Snap Store. I <em>want</em> this ecosystem to succeed - I still maintain nearly 50 packages there myself. But pretending there isn&rsquo;t a problem helps nobody.</p>\n<p>The domain takeover angle is particularly concerning because it undermines one of the few trust signals users had: publisher longevity. Canonical needs to address this, whether that&rsquo;s monitoring for domain expiry on publisher accounts, requiring additional verification for accounts that have been dormant, implementing mandatory two-factor authentication, or something else entirely. I don&rsquo;t have all the answers, but I know the current situation isn&rsquo;t sustainable.</p>\n<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re a snap publisher</strong>: keep your domain registration current, and enable two-factor authentication if you haven&rsquo;t already. Your lapsed domain could become someone else&rsquo;s attack vector.</p>\n<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re a snap user</strong>: be extremely cautious with cryptocurrency wallet applications from <em>any</em> source, not just the Snap Store. Check the publisher, check when the snap was last updated, and if something feels off, it probably is. Actually, scratch that - just don&rsquo;t install crypto wallet apps from app stores at all. Get them directly from the official project websites.</p>\n<p><strong>If you spot something dodgy</strong>: report it. Use the &ldquo;Report this app&rdquo; link at the bottom of the snap&rsquo;s store page. The community catching these before they catch users is the best defence we&rsquo;ve got right now.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll keep monitoring via <a href=\"https://snapscope.popey.com/\">SnapScope</a> and reporting what I find. Someone has to.</p>\n<p>Stay safe out there.</p>",

Naming things is hard, but given that I want to put a &#8220;Q&#8221; in the name, googling &#8220;cute stripes&#8221; gives lots of hits about fashion, and the other too-obvious-to-say pun, I&#8217;ve pushed it to GitHub as &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/steveire/qashmere\">Qashmere</a>&#8220;:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png\"><img width=\"988\" height=\"870\" data-attachment-id=\"1761\" data-permalink=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/2026/01/14/rest-api-development-with-qt-6/qashmere/\" data-orig-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png\" data-orig-size=\"988,870\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"qashmere\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=450\" src=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=988\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1761\" srcset=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png 988w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=150 150w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=300 300w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">setAlternatingRowColors(true);</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers using REST APIs will generally be familiar with existing tooling such as Postman and Bruno, for synthesizing calls to collections of REST APIs. Indeed, Qashmere uses the Stripe Postman JSON definition to present the collection of APIs and parameters. Such tools have scripting interfaces and state to create workflows that a client of the REST API needs to support, like &#8220;create a payment, get the id of the payment back from the REST API and then cancel the payment with the id&#8221;, or &#8220;create a payment, get the id of the payment back from the REST API and then confirm it by id with a given credit card&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why create Qashmere? In addition to REST APIs, Stripe maintains objects which change state over time. The objects remain at REST until acted on by an external force, and when such an action happens a notification is sent to clients about those state changes, giving them a chance to react. I wanted to be able to collect the REST requests/responses and the notified events and present them as they relate to the Stripe objects. Postman doesn&#8217;t know about events or about Stripe objects in particular, except that it is possible to write a script in Postman to extract the object which is part of a JSON payload. Postman also doesn&#8217;t know that if a Payment Intent is created, there are a subset of next steps which could be in a workflow, such as cancel, capture or confirm payment etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something that I discovered in the course of trying this out is that when I confirm a Payment Intent, a new Charge object is created and sent to me with the event notification system. Experimental experiences like that help build intuition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png\"><img width=\"870\" height=\"814\" data-attachment-id=\"1763\" data-permalink=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/2026/01/14/rest-api-development-with-qt-6/qashmere_2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png\" data-orig-size=\"870,814\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"qashmere_2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=450\" src=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=870\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1763\" srcset=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png 870w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=150 150w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=300 300w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_2.png?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stripe operates with real money, but it also provides for sandboxes where synthetic payments, customers etc can be created and processed with synthetic payment methods and cards. As Qashmere is only useful as a developer tool or learning aid, it only works with Stripe sandboxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Events from Stripe are sent to pre-configured web servers owned by the client. The web servers need to have a public IP address, which is obviously not appropriate for a desktop application. A WebSocket API would be more suitable and indeed the stripe cli tool uses a WebSocket to receive events, but the WebSocket protocol is not documented or stable. Luckily the stripe cli tool can be used to relay events to another HTTP server, so Qashmere runs a <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qhttpserver.html\"><code>QHttpServer</code></a> for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"483\" data-attachment-id=\"1754\" data-permalink=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/2026/01/14/rest-api-development-with-qt-6/qashmere_architecture-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1379,651\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"qashmere_architecture\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=450\" src=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1754\" srcset=\"https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=1024 1024w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=150 150w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=300 300w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png?w=768 768w, https://steveire.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/qashmere_architecture-1.png 1379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Implementation with Qt REST API</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qrestreply.html\"><code>QRestReply</code></a> wraps a <code>QNetworkReply</code> pointer and provides convenience API for accessing the HTTP return code and for creating a <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qjsondocument.html\"><code>QJsonDocument</code></a> from the body of the response. It must be created manually if using <code>QNetworkAccessManager</code> directly. However the new <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qrestaccessmanager.html\"><code>QRestAccessManager</code></a> wraps a <code>QNetworkAccessManager</code> pointer, again to provide convenience APIs and overloads for making requests that are needed in REST APIs (though some less common verbs like <code>OPTIONS</code> and <code>TRACE</code> are not built-in). The <code>QRestAccessManager</code> has conveniences like overloads that provide a way to supply callbacks which already take the <code>QRestReply</code> wrapper object as a parameter. If using a <code>QJsonDocument</code> request overload, the &#8220;<code>application/json</code>&#8221; <code>Content-Type</code> is automatically set in the header.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the inconveniences of <code>QRestAccessManager</code> is that in Qashmere I use an external definition of the REST API from the Postman definition which includes the HTTP method. Because the <code>QRestAccessManager</code> provides strongly typed API for making requests I need to do something like:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">if (method == &quot;POST&quot;) {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    rest.post(request, requestData, this, replyHandler);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">} else if (method == &quot;GET&quot;) {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    rest.get(request, this, replyHandler);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">} else if (method == &quot;DELETE&quot;) {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    rest.deleteResource(request, this, replyHandler);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">}</div></code></pre>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>There is a <code>sendCustomRequest</code> class API which can be used with a string, but it does not have an overload for <code>QJsonDocument</code>, so the convenience of having the <code>Content-Type</code> header set is lost. This may be an oversight in the <code>QRestAccessManager</code> API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another missing feature is URL parameter interpolation. Many REST APIs are described as something like <code>/v1/object/:object_id/cancel</code>, and it would be convenient to have a safe way to interpolate the parameters into the URL, such as:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">QUrl result = QRestAccessManager::interpolatePathParameters(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    &quot;/v1/accounts/:account_id/object/:object_id/cancel&quot;, {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        {&quot;account_id&quot;, &quot;acc_1234&quot;},</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        {&quot;object_id&quot;, &quot;obj_5678&quot;}</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    }</div><div class=\"cm-line\">);</div></code></pre>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>This is needed to avoid bugs such as a user-supplied parameter containing a slash for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coding Con Currency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years I&#8217;ve been writing and reading more Typescript/Angular code which consumes REST services, and less C++. I&#8217;ve enjoyed the way <code>Promise</code>s work in that environment, allowing sequences of REST requests, for example, to be easy to write and read. A test of a pseudo API could <code>await</code> on requests to complete and invoke the next one with something like:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">requestFactory.setBaseURL(&quot;http://some_service.com&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">async testWorkflow(username: string, password: string) {</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const loginRequest = requestFactory.makeRequest(&quot;/login&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const loginRequestData = new Map();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    loginRequestData.setParam(&quot;username&quot;, username);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    loginRequestData.setParam(&quot;password&quot;, password);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const loginResponse = await requestAPI.post(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        loginRequest, loginRequestData);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const bearerToken = loginResponse.getData();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    requestAPI.setBearerToken(bearerToken);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const listingRequest = requestFactory.makeRequest(&quot;/list_items&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const listingResponse = await requestAPI.get(listingRequest);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const listing = JSON.parse(listingResponse.getData());</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const firstItemRequest = requestFactory.makeRequest(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        &quot;/retrieve_item/:item_id&quot;, </div><div class=\"cm-line\">        {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            item_id: listing[0].item_id</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        }</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    );</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    const firstItem = await requestAPI.get(firstItemRequest);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">}</div></code></pre>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The availability of <code>async</code> functions and the <code>Promise</code> to await on make a test like this quite easy to write, and the in-application use of the API uses the same <code>Promise</code>s, so there is little friction between application code and test code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to see if I can recreate something like that based on the Qt networking APIs. I briefly tried using C++20 coroutines because they would allow a style closer to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, but the integration friction with existing Qt types was higher than I wanted for an experiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the methods in <code>QtFuture</code> however, we already have a way to create objects representing the response from a REST API. The result is similar to the Typescript example, but with different ergonomics, using <code>.then</code> instead of the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">struct RestRequest</div><div class=\"cm-line\">{</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QString method;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QString requestUrl;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QHttpHeaders headers;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QHash&lt;QString, QString&gt; urlParams;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QUrlQuery queryParams;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    std::variant&lt;QUrlQuery, QJsonDocument&gt; requestData;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">};</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">struct RestResponse</div><div class=\"cm-line\">{</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QJsonDocument jsonDoc;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QHttpHeaders headers;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QNetworkReply::NetworkError error;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    QUrl url;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    int statusCode;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">};</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QFuture&lt;RestResponse&gt; makeRequest(RestRequest restRequest)</div><div class=\"cm-line\">{</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    auto url = interpolatePathParameters(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        restRequest.requestUrl, </div><div class=\"cm-line\">        restRequest.urlParams);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    auto request = requestFactory.createRequest(url);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    auto requestBodyDoc = extractRequestContent(restRequest.requestData);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    auto requestBody = requestBodyDoc.toJson(QJsonDocument::Compact);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    auto reply = qRestManager.sendCustomRequest(request,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">                                                restRequest.method.toUtf8(),</div><div class=\"cm-line\">                                                requestBody,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">                                                &amp;qnam,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">                                                [](QRestReply &amp;) {});</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    return QtFuture::connect(reply, &amp;QNetworkReply::finished).then(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        [reply]() {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            QRestReply restReply(reply);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    </div><div class=\"cm-line\">            auto responseDoc = restReply.readJson();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            if (!responseDoc) {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">                throw std::runtime_error(&quot;Failed to read response&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            }</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    </div><div class=\"cm-line\">            RestResponse response;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            response.jsonDoc = *responseDoc;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            response.statusCode = restReply.httpStatus();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            response.error = restReply.error();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            response.headers = reply-&gt;headers();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">            response.url = reply-&gt;url();</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    </div><div class=\"cm-line\">            return response;</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        }</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    );</div><div class=\"cm-line\">}</div></code></pre>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The <code>QRestAccessManager</code> API requires the creation of a dummy response function when creating a custom request because it is not really designed to be used this way. The result is an API accepting a request and returning a <code>QFuture</code> with the <code>QJsonDocument</code> content. While it is possible for a REST endpoint to return something else, we can follow the Qt philosophy of making the most expected case as easy as possible, while leaving most of the rest possible another way. This utility makes writing unit tests relatively straightforward too:<br></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">RemoteAPI remoteApi;</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">remoteApi.setBaseUrl(QUrl(&quot;https://dog.ceo&quot;));</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">auto responseFuture = remoteApi.makeRequest(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    {&quot;GET&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     &quot;api/breed/:breed/:sub_breed/images/random&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {},</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">         {&quot;breed&quot;, &quot;wolfhound&quot;}, </div><div class=\"cm-line\">         {&quot;sub_breed&quot;, &quot;irish&quot;}</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     }});</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QFutureWatcher&lt;RestResponse&gt; watcher;</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QSignalSpy spy(&amp;watcher, &amp;QFutureWatcherBase::finished);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">watcher.setFuture(responseFuture);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QVERIFY(spy.wait(10000));</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">auto jsonObject = responseFuture.result().jsonDoc.object();</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QCOMPARE(jsonObject[&quot;status&quot;], &quot;success&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QRegularExpression regex(</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    R&quot;(https://images\\.dog\\.ceo/breeds/wolfhound-irish/[^.]+.jpg)&quot;);</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QVERIFY(regex.match(jsonObject[&quot;message&quot;].toString()).hasMatch());</div></code></pre>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The result is quite similar to the Typescript above, but only because we can use <code>spy.wait</code>. In application code, we still need to use <code>.then</code> with a callback, but we can additionally use <code>.onFailed</code> and <code>.onCanceled</code> instead of making multiple signal/slot connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the addition of <code>QtFuture::whenAll</code>, it is easy to make multiple REST requests at once and react when they are all finished, so perhaps something else has been gained too, compared to a signal/slot model:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-code\">\n\t<div class=\"cm-editor\">\n\t\t<div class=\"cm-scroller\">\n\t\t\t\n<pre><code><div class=\"cm-line\">RemoteAPI remoteApi;</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">remoteApi.setBaseUrl(QUrl(&quot;https://dog.ceo&quot;));</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">auto responseFuture = remoteApi.requestMultiple({</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    {</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        &quot;GET&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">        &quot;api/breeds/list/all&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">    },</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    {&quot;GET&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     &quot;api/breed/:breed/:sub_breed/images/random&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {},</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {{&quot;breed&quot;, &quot;german&quot;}, {&quot;sub_breed&quot;, &quot;shepherd&quot;}}},</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    {&quot;GET&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     &quot;api/breed/:breed/:sub_breed/images/random/:num_results&quot;,</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {},</div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {{&quot;breed&quot;, &quot;wolfhound&quot;}, </div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {&quot;sub_breed&quot;, &quot;irish&quot;}, </div><div class=\"cm-line\">     {&quot;num_results&quot;, &quot;3&quot;}}},</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">    {&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;api/breed/:breed/list&quot;, {}, {{&quot;breed&quot;, &quot;hound&quot;}}},</div><div class=\"cm-line\">});</div><div class=\"cm-line\"></div><div class=\"cm-line\">QFutureWatcher&lt;QList&lt;RestResponse&gt;&gt;

The additions are valuable, but it seems that there are a few places where improvements might be possible. My attempt to make the API feel closer to what developers in other environments might be accustomed to had some success, but I&#8217;m not sure <code>QFuture</code> is really intended to be used this way.<br>Do readers have any feedback? Would using QCoro improve the coroutine experience? Is it very unusual to create an application with QWidgets instead of QML these days? Should I have used PyQt and the python networking APIs?</p>",

The key point here is: it's either one way, or it's the other. You can switch between ways, but it takes a bit of mental effort. And it can't be both at once.</p>\n<p>This is how I feel about 2025. Some stuff happened, some of it amazing, and I am glad the year is over.</p>\n<p>There are, I think, four major separate stuffs on that list. Obviously, what actually occupies your mind day to day is the more minor things; you got bolognaise sauce on your good shirt (did that) or your job changed a bit (did that) or you really need to lose some weight or you're nearly fifty or they're <em>still</em> not <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Birmingham_bin_strike\">collecting the bins</a>. But I'll not bore you to tears with all of that; only my head should be pecked by this sort of thing, not everybody's.</p>\n<p>Last year, on my birthday, I <a href=\"https://www.kryogenix.org/days/2025/01/30/forty-nine/\">wrote</a> \"Maybe 2025 will be better, although to be honest I doubt it.\" Oh, sweet summer child. If you only knew.</p>\n<p>In March, my dad died.</p>\n<p>This, for those of you who do not know, sucks. A very large amount.</p>\n<p>It wasn't <em>unexpected</em>. He'd been unwell for a while, and getting worse. And he knew what was happening, and wasn't suffering much, and was content. It could have been considerably worse on that front than it was. We might consider that sort of thing tactical unhappiness: short term, dominates your thinking right now, but you need to reach beyond it. The strategic unhappiness, that's what he could see ahead for himself, and he didn't want it, and I think he was right in that and I'm glad that's what he chose, and I'm glad that he chose it. We tried to express that at the <a href=\"https://www.kryogenix.org/peter/\">funeral</a> and the wake with eulogies and readings and hugs and memories, and that's where I said everything that I wanted to say, and that went OK -- well, as OK as you can expect for your dad's funeral. Mardi Gras it was not. But the old man left a handprint on the world that made it better, and that's most of what you can hope for.</p>\n<p>It's hard with him gone, though. You play all these moody film moments in your head with yourself in the starring role, of monumental grief that takes people's breath away, of sombre melancholy where you're nonetheless handsomely well-dressed in a rainy black-and-white street scene and people whisper under their breath how brave and noble you are for handling it so well. You imagine how you'll be when the next one dies. What you should have done instead. Or, maybe <em>you</em> don't do that at all, which is probably a better and more caring way to be. The things people warn you about -- how you'll think, oh that's cool I need to ask dad about that, and then remember that ah, no, I can't -- that goes away pretty fast. The needle changes direction from sadness to wistfulness, loss rather than bitterness; the thing's still there but the opacity of it drops gradually over time, even though it'll never fully go away. Not entirely.</p>\n<p>It's harder on my mum. They were married for over fifty years, for goodness's sake. I only managed ten; I can hardly imagine what it's like for something that's been there for half a century to suddenly be gone. How do you even imagine that? It's been a rough year for her, it really has. Christmas, the first Christmas, was hard. I'm used to living alone; she is not, quite apart from the emotional turmoil. And that's where all the minor things come into play; something tiny that happens each day and feels like so much more a burden. You're supposed to not let the bastards grind you down, but the problem is that a lot of the time there aren't any bastards. There's just... life. Life's hard to deal with, when you're dealing with things.</p>\n<p>So, was it all bad? No. There are some bright spots: some that are so great that they're almost blinding.</p>\n<p>My daughter is engaged, to a decent guy, and they're pregnant. Next June, I'll be a grandfather.</p>\n<p>This is cool.</p>\n<p>I think I'm the first, among my friends. This isn't that surprising; I was the first to get married, too, we got started early. But I'm pretty excited about the idea of being a grandad. I still have to work stuff out -- do I need to keep Werther's Originals in my pocket all the time? Buy a flat cap? -- but man, this is going to be great. I liked my grandparents, even the ones I don't really remember; if I can be as good as they were, as good as my dad was for my daughter, I'll be happy with that. And we can read books together! Go look at cool stuff! Make dinners and giggle a lot! Maybe not for the first couple of years, admittedly, but as I understand it when the more, er, brown-stained bits of parenthood come around I get to just hand my grandchild back. I served my time on that sort of thing. I just get the fun bits. Hooray!</p>\n<p>It did occur to me that there were times when my daughter was very young that we'd say, hey, we can drop her on the grandparents for a weekend and actually go to the pub again. And now I am the grandad being dropped upon... but I am OK with this. There are <em>so</em> many books we're going to share together. Bring it on. I'm really looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>You see, it's not all bad. I have wonderful friends -- we almost all got together in what I am told is now called \"Twixtmas\" (and which I refuse to call \"the merryneum\", thank you Bruce), the bit in between Christmas and New Year, and I had such an excellent day. One of the highlights of my year, every year. <a href=\"https://open-web-advocacy.org/en/\">Open Web Advocacy</a> has had quite some successes this year. I got a neat new cooking pot for Christmas which I'm really looking forward to trying out.</p>\n<p>But then there's the fourth thing: we've had death, engagement, grandfatherhood, and finally we have... the world. A world which is getting a little bit worse, every day. A little bit more mean, a little bit more cold, a little bit more gilded and segregated and exclusionary. My industry, my internet, my web, the thing I built (other people were also involved, I admit) is not what we all wanted it to be. Our place, our internet, is no longer ours; it belongs to the arseholes, to everyone who exchanges decency and joy for money and control and considers themselves superior and visionary for doing it. Plenty of people who actually are wise and eloquent have written recently about this, and how bad it is, and what can be done about it, or just how exhausting it is for it to happen: see <a href=\"https://craphound.com/shop/\">Cory</a> or <a href=\"https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/\">Henry</a> or <a href=\"https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/our-frail-thoughts/\">Ethan</a> or <a href=\"https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/this-is-not-a-2025-wrap-up-post/\">Salma</a> or, or, or. But the world is worse, every day, and it makes me dread what's coming.</p>\n<p>And so I confront the question: was 2025 a bad year with some good bits, or a good year with some bad bits?</p>\n<p>I think that it's up to me. Remember the Necker cube, from one hundred years ago when I started writing this? How you get to choose, with a little bit of effort, which way it points? I reckon that seems right. I could see 2025 as having been a crap year with a couple of bright spots that were drowned by the misery, and that is in fact what I've mostly been doing. But I don't think it helps, and I don't think it's healthy. The world is increasingly shit, and it's considerably more shit for people who aren't as lucky as me, and it's that way because of people who want it that way, and there there really are bastards and I could let <em>those</em> bastards grind me down... but I don't wanna. I'm trying to make a conscious effort to flip the cube, to look forward to the good stuff that's coming and not look down at my feet to avoid the bad. I apologise in advance for all the days to come when I don't quite manage it.</p>\n<p>So, that was 2025. Goodbye, dad. Hello, your great-grandchild, whoever they turn out to be. I hope it's just better and I don't need to try to perceive it that way, but... if it isn't, I'll try anyway.</p>\n<p>Here's to 2026. Fingers crossed.</p>",

This particular post is closely based on <a href=\"https://blog.communitydata.science/effects-of-algorithmic-flagging-on-fairness-quasi-experimental-evidence-from-wikipedia/\">a previously published post</a> by <a href=\"https://teblunthuis.cc/\">Nate TeBlunthuis</a> from <a href=\"https://blog.communitydata.science/\">the Community Data Science Blog</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many online platforms are adopting AI and machine learning as a tool to maintain order and high-quality information in the face of massive influxes of user-generated content. Of course, AI algorithms can be inaccurate, biased, or unfair. How do signals from AI predictions shape the fairness of online content moderation? How can we measure an algorithmic flagging system&#8217;s effects?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449130\">paper published at CSCW</a>, Nate TeBlunthuis, together with myself and Aaron Halfaker, analyzed the <em><a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES/RCFilters\">RCFilters</a></em> system: an add-on to Wikipedia that highlights and filters edits that <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES\">a machine learning</a> algorithm <a href=\"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/ORES\">called ORES</a> identifies as likely to be damaging to Wikipedia. This system has been deployed on large Wikipedia language editions and is similar to other algorithmic flagging systems that are becoming increasingly widespread. Our work measures the causal effect of being flagged in the RCFilters user interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"233\" src=\"https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ores-1024x233.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1447\" srcset=\"https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ores-1024x233.png 1024w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ores-300x68.png 300w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ores-768x175.png 768w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ores.png 1117w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot of Wikipedia edit metadata on Special:RecentChanges with RCFilters enabled. Highlighted edits with a colored circle to the left side of other metadata are flagged by ORES. Different circle and highlight colors (white, yellow, orange, and red in the figure) correspond to different levels of confidence that the edit is damaging. RCFilters does not specifically flag edits by new accounts or unregistered editors, but does support filtering changes by editor types.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work takes advantage of the fact that RCFilters, like many algorithmic flagging systems, create <em>discontinuities</em> in the relationship between the probability that a moderator should take action and whether a moderator actually does.  This happens because the output of machine learning systems like ORES is typically a <em>continuous score</em> (in RCFilters, an estimated probability that a Wikipedia edit is damaging), while the flags (in RCFilters, the yellow, orange, or red highlights) are either on or off and are triggered when the score crosses some arbitrary threshold.  As a result, edits slightly above the threshold are both more visible to moderators and appear more likely to be damaging than edits slightly below.  Even though edits on either side of the threshold have virtually the same likelihood of truly being damaging, the flagged edits are substantially more likely to be reverted. This fact lets us use a method called <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_discontinuity_design\">regression discontinuity</a></em> to make causal estimates of the effect of being flagged in RCFilters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"636\" src=\"https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_2022-07-11_09-41-39-1024x636.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1446\" srcset=\"https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_2022-07-11_09-41-39-1024x636.png 1024w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_2022-07-11_09-41-39-300x186.png 300w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_2022-07-11_09-41-39-768x477.png 768w, https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Screenshot_2022-07-11_09-41-39.png 1257w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Charts showing the probability that an edit will be reverted as a function of ORES scores in the neighborhood of the discontinuous threshold that triggers the RCfilters flag. The jump in the increase in reversion chances is larger for registered editors compared to unregistered editors at both thresholds.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how this system may affect the fairness of Wikipedia moderation, we estimate the effects of flagging on edits on different groups of editors. Comparing the magnitude of these estimates lets us measure how flagging is associated with several different definitions of fairness. <em>Surprisingly, we found evidence that these flags improved fairness for categories of editors that have been widely perceived as troublesome—particularly unregistered (anonymous) editors</em>. This occurred because flagging has a much stronger effect on edits by the registered than on edits by the unregistered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that our results are driven by the fact that algorithmic flags are especially helpful for finding damage that can&#8217;t be easily detected otherwise. Wikipedia moderators can see the editor&#8217;s registration status in the recent changes, watchlists, and edit history. Because unregistered editors are often troublesome, Wikipedia moderators&#8217; attention is often focused on their contributions, with or without algorithmic flags. Algorithmic flags make damage by registered editors (in addition to unregistered editors) much more detectable to moderators and so help moderators focus on damage overall, not just damage by suspicious editors. <em>As a result, the algorithmic flagging system decreases the bias that moderators have against unregistered editors.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This finding is particularly surprising because the ORES algorithm we analyzed was itself demonstrably biased against<em> </em>unregistered editors (i.e., the algorithm tended to greatly overestimate the probability that edits by these editors were damaging).  Despite the fact that the algorithms were biased, their introduction could still lead to less biased outcomes overall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our work shows that although it is important to design predictive algorithms to avoid such biases, it is equally important to study fairness at the level of the broader sociotechnical system. Since we first published a preprint of our paper, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3531146.3533147\">a follow-up piece by Leijie Wang and Haiyi Zhu</a> replicated much of our work and showed that differences between different Wikipedia communities may be another important factor driving the effect of the system. Overall, this work suggests that social signals and social context can interact with algorithmic signals, and together these can influence behavior in important and unexpected ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">The full citation for the paper is: TeBlunthuis, Nathan, Benjamin Mako Hill, and Aaron Halfaker. 2021. “Effects of Algorithmic Flagging on Fairness: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Wikipedia.” <em>Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction</em> 5 (CSCW): 56:1-56:27. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3449130\">https://doi.org/10.1145/3449130</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">We have also released <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/E0RYJ4\">replication materials for the paper</a>, including all the data and code used to conduct the analysis and compile the paper itself.</p>",

It&#8217;s a great mix of folks who are very local, and open source experts from across the country who come in for the event. Beth Lynn Eicher, who leads the event, is a champion in getting more folks involved in open source, and I&#8217;ve heard so many stories of how encouraging she always is to newcomers. There are key folks today you may have interacted with in open source communities who can thank Beth Lynn for encouragement in the early days that got them on the path to where they are today. Personally, I&#8217;ve also worked with her on some non-profit work with <a href=\"https://www.computerreach.org/\">Computer Reach</a>, most notable of which was going to Ghana together for a few weeks back in 2012 to support a deployment they were doing with a Ghanaian NGO.</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_lyz_bethlynn.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_lyz_bethlynn_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>So first, thanks to Beth Lynn, Vance Kochenderfer, Susan Rose Dudenhoefer, and the other volunteers who brought the event together this year on a tight deadline. I&#8217;m so grateful I thought to include the conference on my quarterly event requests in spite of it not being announced yet!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also mention that I keep calling it &#8220;Ohio LinuxFest&#8221; but they rebranded as &#8220;OLF Conference&#8221; to reflect &#8220;Open Libre Free&#8221; and their goal to include operating systems beyond Linux, mea culpa!</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_banner.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_banner_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>The event itself was a lot of fun. It was smaller than in years past, as they went with one track. They mentioned at closing that doing it in December is too late in the year, and along with the short runway for the conference likely impacted attendance. Still, if I had to guess I&#8217;d say there were a couple hundred people there.</p>\n<p>I saw a lot of familiar faces. My friend Scott came out from Pittsburgh, and though we still chat regularly in a group cobbled together from our Ubuntu Pennsylvania days, we hadn&#8217;t seen each other in person in <em>years</em>. It was really cool to catch up, and to laugh about kid stories, since we&#8217;ve both became parents since we last saw each other. I also got to spend a bunch of time with Amber Graner, who I also got to know very well during our time in the Ubuntu project. We&#8217;ve stayed in touch, so we&#8217;re still pretty close, but this was the first time in a while that we had more than 20 minutes to catch up. And new people! I got to chat with a student who was attending an open source conference for his first time, and met several folks who have been working in open source for decades. It really was a great mix of folks.</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_amber_lyz_scott.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_amber_lyz_scott_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>I really enjoyed the opening keynote from Don Vosburg on <em>Passion and Pragmatism</em>. He tugged on a familiar thread in the open source world around the fact that a lot of folks got into open source software &#8220;for fun&#8221; or the passion of it, but most of us eventually had to get professional jobs that may have tested our fundamental commitment to open source. Or other things that have arisen in our lives that require us to make a choice. I&#8217;ve definitely had to walk a line throughout my career, but consider myself quite lucky to have found myself a series of good positions that have allowed me to follow my passion and make a living.</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_passion_pragmatism.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_passion_pragmatism_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>My talk was just after the keynote, and I was very happy that most people stayed! It&#8217;s a re-working of a talk I gave last year, but I notably added an architecture and made some adjustments to my slides about software testing. I was amused to learn that my closing keynote back in 2018 was about doing software testing on your open source project, and that this could be seen as an expansion of that. I joked at the beginning that I was very glad everyone listened to me last time, and now that they all have software testing, it was time to add non-x86_64 hardware architectures into that testing matrix. The slides are available here: <a href=\"/presentations/2025/Will_your_open_source_project_run_on_a_mainframe_Or_a_watch_OLF_2025.pdf\">Will_your_open_source_project_run_on_a_mainframe_Or_a_watch_OLF_2025.pdf</a> (1.2M)</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_lyz.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_lyz_sm.jpg\"></a><br />\n<small>Thanks to Scott for taking a picture during my talk!</small></div>\n<p>Catherine Devlin&#8217;s &#8220;Graph Data for Heroes II: Rise of the Bot&#8221; was an interesting one. A large chunk of it had her scraping web data, and as I was live-posting about it on Mastodon and Bluesky I was speculating about how web scraping is one tech that hasn&#8217;t gotten a whole lot better in 25 years, then mused that it was actually a <em>good</em> use for AI/ML technologies. Indeed, that&#8217;s where her talk went!</p>\n<p>Scattered throughout the conference foyer were a few tables from supporters and sponsors, and I was delighted to see a series of ChromeBooks that had been repurposed to use various Linux distributions. I was delighted to see that Xubuntu made the cut, and when I walked over to check it out I was presented with our shiny new website. Lovely!</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_chromebooks_xubuntu.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_chromebooks_xubuntu_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>In the afternoon I enjoyed seeing Steven Pritchard&#8217;s &#8220;The Great Open Source Rug-Pull&#8221; where he talked about open source software license changes, which have caused a lot of disruption and contention in the open source world these past few years. And although I had heard of <a href=\"https://hackerpublicradio.org/\">Hacker Public Radio</a> before, it wasn&#8217;t until murph&#8217;s talk on the topic, along with a bunch of great tips, that I got a serious look into what it was and how the episodes are crowd sourced. These folks are doing great work.</p>\n<p>Amber Graner concluded the day with the closing keynote &#8220;Bless Their Hearts: Open Source, AI, and Southern Survival Skills.&#8221; She took us on a personal, funny journey through some of the characters and situations in the open source world. I particularly loved at the end where she shared a list of things she wished people had told her when she started contributing to open source. I&#8217;ll be keeping some of these things in mind as I continue working with students who need more than just the basic misconceptions about contributing corrected so they can effectively contribute.</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_bless_their_heart.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_bless_their_heart_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>The end of the event crept up quickly! The group hosted a small closing after party in the hotel lobby with pizza and my favorite, cake!</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_cake.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"/images/journalpics/122025/olf_cake_sm.jpg\"></a></div>\n<p>In what is perhaps one of my shortest conference trips, I flew out at 5AM the next morning to get home by midday on Sunday. It left me pretty tired, but it was worth it.</p>",

I welcome comments and further discussion in that thread.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://lwn.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">LWN</a> featured an excellent article titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/1033809/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Linux&rsquo;s missing CRL infrastructure</a>&rdquo;. The article highlighted a number of key issues surrounding traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), but critically noted how even the available measures are effectively ignored by the majority of system-level software on Linux.</p>\n<p>One of the motivators for the discussion is that the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) will cease to be supported by Let&rsquo;s Encrypt. The remaining alternative is to use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), yet there is little or no support for managing (or even querying) these lists in most Linux system utilities.</p>\n<p>To solve this, I&rsquo;m happy to share that in partnership with <a href=\"https://github.com/rustls/rustls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rustls</a> maintainers <a href=\"https://dirkjan.ochtman.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dirkjan Ochtman</a> and <a href=\"https://jbp.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Joe Birr-Pixton</a>, we&rsquo;re starting the development of upki: a universal PKI tool. This project initially aims to close the revocation gap through the combination of a new system utility and eventual library support for common TLS/SSL libraries such as <a href=\"https://openssl-library.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OpenSSL</a>, <a href=\"https://gnutls.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">GnuTLS</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rustls/rustls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rustls</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\" class=\"relative group\">The Problem <span class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"><a class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#the-problem\" aria-label=\"Anchor\">#</a></span></h2><p>Online Certificate Authorities responsible for issuing TLS certificates have long had mechanisms for revoking known bad certificates. What constitutes a known bad certificate varies, but generally it means a certificate was issued either in error, or by a malicious actor of some form. There have been two primary mechanisms for this revocation: <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Certificate Revocation Lists</a> (CRLs) and the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Online Certificate Status Protocol</a> (OCSP).</p>\n<p>In July 2024, <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Let’s Encrypt</a> <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2024/07/23/replacing-ocsp-with-crls.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">announced</a> the deprecation of support for the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). This wasn&rsquo;t entirely unexpected - the protocol has suffered from privacy defects which leak the browsing habits of users to Certificate Authorities. Various implementations have also suffered reliability issues that forced most implementers to adopt &ldquo;soft-fail&rdquo; policies, rendering the checks largely ineffective.</p>\n<p>The deprecation of OCSP leaves us with CRLs. Both Windows and macOS rely on operating system components to centralise the fetching and parsing of CRLs, but Linux has traditionally delegated this responsibility to individual applications. This is done most effectively in browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Chromium, but this has been achieved with bespoke infrastructure.</p>\n<p>However, Linux itself has fallen short by not providing consistent revocation checking infrastructure for the rest of userspace - tools such as curl, system package managers and language runtimes lack a unified mechanism to process this data.</p>\n<p>The ideal solution to this problem, which is slowly <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/02/from-90-to-45.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">becoming more prevalent</a>, is to issue short-lived credentials with an expiration of 10 days or less, somewhat removing the need for complicated revocation infrastructure, but reducing certificate lifetimes is happening slowly and requires significant automation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"crlite\" class=\"relative group\">CRLite <span class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"><a class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#crlite\" aria-label=\"Anchor\">#</a></span></h2><p>There are several key challenges with CRLs in practice - the size of the list has grown dramatically as the web has scaled, and one must collate CRLs from all relevant certificate authorities in order to be useful. CRLite was originally proposed by researchers at IEEE S&amp;P and subsequently adopted in Mozilla Firefox. It offers a pragmatic solution to the problem of distributing large CRL datasets to client machines.</p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2025/08/crlite-fast-private-and-comprehensive-certificate-revocation-checking-in-firefox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">blog post</a>, Mozilla outlined how their CRLite implementation meant that on average users &ldquo;downloaded 300kB of revocation data per day, a 4MB snapshot every 45 days and a sequence of &ldquo;delta-updates&rdquo; in-between&rdquo;, which amounts to CRLite being 1000x more bandwidth-efficient than daily CRL downloads.</p>\n<p>At its core, CRLite is a data structure compressing the full set of web-PKI revocations into a compact, efficiently queryable form. You can find more information about CRLite&rsquo;s design and implementation on <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/tag/crlite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mozilla&rsquo;s Security Blog</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"introducing-upki\" class=\"relative group\">Introducing upki <span class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"><a class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#introducing-upki\" aria-label=\"Anchor\">#</a></span></h2><p>Following our work on <a href=\"https://jnsgr.uk/2025/03/carefully-but-purposefully-oxidising-ubuntu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">oxidizing Ubuntu</a>, <a href=\"https://dirkjan.ochtman.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dirkjan</a> reached out to me with a proposal to introduce a system-level utility backed by CRLite to non-browser users.</p>\n<p>upki will be an open source project, initially packaged for Ubuntu but available to all Linux distributions, and likely portable to other Unix-like operating systems. Written in Rust, upki supports three roles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Server-side mirroring tool</strong>: responsible for downloading and mirroring the CRLite filters provided by Mozilla, enabling us to operate independent CDN infrastructure for CRLite users, and serving them to clients. This will insulate upki from changes in the Mozilla backend, and enable standing up an independent data source if required. The server-side tool will manifest as a service that periodically checks the Mozilla Firefox CRLite filters, downloads and validates the files, and serves them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Client-side sync tool</strong>: run regularly by a systemd-timer, network-up events or similar, this tool ensures the contents of the CDN are reflected in the on-disk filter cache. This will be extremely low on bandwidth and CPU usage assuming everything is up to date.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Client-side query tool</strong>: a CLI interface for querying revocation data. This will be useful for monitoring and deployment workflows, as well as for users without a good C FFI.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The latter two roles are served by a single Rust binary that runs in different modes depending on how it is invoked. The server-side tool will be a separate binary, since its use will be much less widespread. Under the hood, all of this will be powered by Rust library crates that can be integrated in other projects via crates.io.</p>\n<p>For the initial release, Canonical will stand up the backend infrastructure required to mirror and serve the CRLite data for upki users, though the backend will be configurable. This prevents unbounded load on Mozilla’s infrastructure and ensures long-term stability even if Firefox’s internal formats evolve.</p>\n<p><a href=\"01.png\">\n<figure>\n<picture\nclass=\"mx-auto my-0 rounded-md\"\n>\n<source\nsrcset=\"https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_7aea390858f05c60.webp 330w,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_9154481d5f03e512.webp 660w\n,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_a307b065b53523ff.webp 1024w\n,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_deff65263f4ce937.webp 1320w\n\"\nsizes=\"100vw\"\ntype=\"image/webp\"\n/>\n<img\nwidth=\"1720\"\nheight=\"1670\"\nclass=\"mx-auto my-0 rounded-md\"\nalt=\"architecture diagram for upki\"\nloading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\nsrc=\"https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_8d3d8de37b1371ed.png\" srcset=\"https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_35c62a8a93ce37c3.png 330w,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_8d3d8de37b1371ed.png 660w\n,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_5589b1a5b35835.png 1024w\n,https://jnsgr.uk/2025/12/addressing-linuxs-missing-pki-infra/01_hu_3dea963df0028e69.png 1320w\n\"\nsizes=\"100vw\"\n/>\n</picture>\n</figure>\n</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"ecosystem-compatibility\" class=\"relative group\">Ecosystem Compatibility <span class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"><a class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#ecosystem-compatibility\" aria-label=\"Anchor\">#</a></span></h2><p>So far we&rsquo;ve covered the introduction of a new Rust binary (and crate) for supporting the fetching, serving and querying of CRL data, but that doesn&rsquo;t provide much service to the existing ecosystem of Linux applications and libraries in the problem statement.</p>\n<p>The upki project will also provide a shared object library for a stable ABI that allows C and C-FFI programs to make revocation queries, using the contents of the on-disk filter cache.</p>\n<p>Once <code>upki</code> is released and available, work can begin on integrating existing crypto libraries such as OpenSSL, GNUtls and rustls.

    "contentHtml": "<p>Let’s be honest. Dealing with <strong>broken updates</strong> is a nightmare. We’ve all experienced that moment of panic when you run an update, step away for coffee, and return to a terminal screen full of angry red error messages. That is exactly why uCareSystem exists, and today, it gets even better at preventing these issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-49934\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fix Broken Updates: uCareSystem New Release</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to announce the latest release of <a href=\"https://utappia.org/download-ucaresystem/\">uCareSystem</a>. As the sole developer, I feel the pain of <strong>broken updates</strong> personally. For this version, I spent a lot of time under the hood, focusing on making sure the tool doesn&#8217;t just work when everything is perfect, but proactively fixes issues before they break your system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is why you should upgrade to the new version and say goodbye to <strong>broken updates</strong> for good:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prevent Broken Updates with Pre-flight Checks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most frustrating <strong>broken updates</strong> are the ones that fail because of something that happened <em>last</em> week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new uCareSystem introduces automated pre-flight checks. Think of it as a bouncer for your update process. Before it lets any new packages in, it checks the ID of your system to prevent <strong>broken updates</strong>. It now automatically detects and attempts to fix:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Those annoying stale <code>dpkg</code> locks that require a reboot.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Installations that were interrupted (ghosts of updates past).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Broken dependencies that threaten to ruin your day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is simple: You press the button, and it actually works.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A UI Upgrade for Better Monitoring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While staring at scrolling walls of monochrome text makes us feel like hackers in a 90s movie, it’s not great for spotting errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve given the uCareSystem terminal interface a significant makeover. With improved color coding, better progress indicators, and real-time output logging, you’ll now have a much clearer idea of the process, helping you catch potential issues that could lead to <strong>broken updates</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Robustness: Avoiding Broken Updates in Containers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Linux runs everywhere now. To keep up, uCareSystem needs to be flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Containers &amp; WSL:</strong> I’ve improved <code>systemd</code> detection so the tool plays nicely even in environments like Docker containers and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Internet Reality Check:</strong> I added better connectivity checks. Trying to download updates without a stable connection is a common cause of <strong>broken updates</strong>, and we now handle that gracefully.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Auto-Recovery:</strong> If a <code>dpkg</code> process trips and falls midway, the software now has mechanisms to help pick it back up automatically.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spring Cleaning the Code with ShellCheck</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the code-peepers out there who like to look under the hood: I did some massive spring cleaning. Extensive refactoring and complying with <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.shellcheck.net/\">ShellCheck</a> standards mean the codebase is now cleaner and safer. This ensures better maintainability and fewer bugs in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Give the new version a spin. Hopefully, it makes your system maintenance totally boring—and completely free of <strong>broken updates</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">By the Numbers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a significant undertaking, reflected in the statistics for this release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>38 files changed: </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2,030 additions, </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>718 deletions</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Please take a look to a comprehensive Release note in the repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/Utappia/uCareSystem/releases/tag/v25.12.04\">https://github.com/Utappia/uCareSystem/releases/tag/v25.12.04</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release is a testament to my commitment to quality and my vision for the future of uCareSystem as a one-stop system maintenance tool Debian Ubuntu. I am confident that I laid a stronger foundation that will allow for even more exciting features and faster development in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am deeply grateful to the community members who supported the previous development cycle through donations or code contributions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>P. Laoughman (Thanks for your continued support)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>W. Schreinemachers (Thanks for your continued support)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>D. Luchini (Thanks for your continued support)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M.

Rasmussen</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Every version, has also a code name dedicated as a release honored to one of the contributors. For historical reference, you can check all <a href=\"https://github.com/Utappia/uCareSystem/blob/master/HONORED_RELEASES.md\">previous honored releases</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I download uCareSystem ?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I want to express my gratitude for your support over the past 15 years. I have received countless messages from inside and outside Greece about how useful they found the application. I hope you find the new version useful as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve found uCareSystem to be valuable and it has saved you time, consider showing your appreciation with a donation.

We are in luck, because the excellent QEMU project has a user space emulator! It can be compiled as a dynamically linked executable, honors LD_PRELOAD and uses the host libc&#8217;s syscall &#8211; well, at least sometimes. Sometimes syscalls just bypass libc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The missing piece was a way to make QEMU always take the interposable path and call the host libc instead of using an arch-specifix assembly routine (`safe_syscall_base`) to construct the syscall and going directly to the kernel. Luckily, this turned out to be doable. A small patch later, QEMU gained a switch that forces all syscalls through libc. Suddenly, our static binaries started looking a lot more dynamic!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ faketime '2008-12-24 08:15:42'  qemu-x86_64 ./test_static_clock_gettime\n2008-12-24 08:15:42.725404654\n$ file test_static_clock_gettime \ntest_clock_gettime: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, ...</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in place, Firebuild can finally wrap even those secretive statically linked tools. QEMU runs them, libc catches their syscalls, <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> injects <code>libfirebuild.so</code>, and from there the usual interposition magic happens. The result: previously uncachable build steps can now be traced, cached, and shortcut just like their dynamic friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one more problem though. Why would the static binaries deep in the build be run by QEMU? Firebuild also intercepts the `exec()` calls and now it rewrites them on the fly whenever the executed binary would be statically linked!</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ firebuild -d comm bash -c ./test_static\n...\nFIREBUILD: fd 9.1: ({ExecedProcess 161077.1, running, \"bash -c ./test_static\", fds=&#91;0: {FileFD ofd={FileO\nFD #0 type=FD_PIPE_IN r} cloexec=false}, 1: {FileFD ofd={FileOFD #3 type=FD_PIPE_OUT w} {Pipe #0} close_o\nn_popen=false cloexec=false}, 2: {FileFD ofd={FileOFD #4 type=FD_PIPE_OUT w} {Pipe #1} close_on_popen=fal\nse cloexec=false}, 3: {FileFD NULL} /* times 2 */]})\n{\n    \"&#91;FBBCOMM_TAG]\": \"exec\",\n    \"file\": \"test_static\",\n    \"// fd\": null,\n    \"// dirfd\": null,\n    \"arg\": &#91;\n        \"./test_static\"\n    ],\n    \"env\": &#91;\n        \"SHELL=/bin/bash\",\n ...\n        \"FB_SOCKET=/tmp/firebuild.cpMn75/socket\",\n        \"_=./test_static\"\n    ],\n    \"with_p\": false,\n    \"// path\": null,\n    \"utime_u\": 0,\n    \"stime_u\": 1017\n}\nFIREBUILD: -> proc_ic_msg()  (message_processor.cc:782)  proc={ExecedProcess 161077.1, running, \"bash -c \n./test_static\", fds=&#91;0: {FileFD ofd={FileOFD #0 type=FD_PIPE_IN r} cloexec=false}, 1: {FileFD ofd={FileOF\nD #3 type=FD_PIPE_OUT w} {Pipe #0} close_on_popen=false cloexec=false}, 2: {FileFD ofd={FileOFD #4 type=F\nD_PIPE_OUT w} {Pipe #1} close_on_popen=false cloexec=false}, 3: {FileFD NULL} /* times 2 */]}, fd_conn=9.\n1, tag=exec, ack_num=0\nFIREBUILD:   -> send_fbb()  (utils.cc:292)  conn=9.1, ack_num=0 fd_count=0\nSending message with ancillary fds &#91;]:\n{\n    \"&#91;FBBCOMM_TAG]\": \"rewritten_args\",\n    \"arg\": &#91;\n        \"/usr/bin/qemu-user-interposable\",\n        \"-libc-syscalls\",\n        \"./test_static\"\n    ],\n    \"path\": \"/usr/bin/qemu-user-interposable\"\n}\n...\nFIREBUILD: -> accept_ic_conn()  (firebuild.cc:139)  listener=6\n...\nFIREBUILD: fd 9.2: ({Process NULL})\n{\n    \"&#91;FBBCOMM_TAG]\": \"scproc_query\",\n    \"pid\": 161077,\n    \"ppid\": 161073,\n    \"cwd\": \"/home/rbalint/projects/firebuild/test\",\n    \"arg\": &#91;\n        \"/usr/bin/qemu-user-interposable\",\n        \"-libc-syscalls\",\n        \"./test_static\"\n    ],\n    \"env_var\": &#91;\n        \"CCACHE_DISABLE=1\",\n...\n        \"SHELL=/bin/bash\",\n        \"SHLVL=0\",\n        \"_=./test_static\"\n    ],\n    \"umask\": \"0002\",\n    \"jobserver_fds\": &#91;],\n    \"// jobserver_fifo\": null,\n    \"executable\": \"/usr/bin/qemu-user-interposable\",\n    \"// executed_path\": null,\n    \"// original_executed_path\": null,\n    \"libs\": &#91;\n        \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libatomic.so.1\",\n        \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6\",\n        \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libglib-2.0.so.0\",\n        \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6\",\n        \"/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre2-8.so.0\",\n        \"/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2\"\n    ],\n    \"version\": \"0.8.5.1\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The QEMU patch is <a href=\"https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2025-11/msg02559.html\">forwarded to qemu-devel</a>. If it lands, anyone using QEMU user-mode emulation could benefit — not just Firebuild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Firebuild users, though, the impact is immediate. Toolchains that mix dynamic and static helpers? Cross-builds that pull in odd little statically linked utilities? Previously “invisible” steps in your builds? All now fair game for caching.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/firebuild/firebuild/releases/tag/v0.8.5\">Firebuild 0.8.5</a> ships this new capability out of the box. Just update, make sure you’re using a patched QEMU, and enjoy the feeling of watching even static binaries fall neatly into place in your cached build graph. Ubuntu users can get the prebuilt patched QEMU packages from the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~firebuild/+archive/ubuntu/stable\">Firebuild PPA</a> already. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Static binaries, welcome to the party!</p>",

This, of course, is on us to define.</p>\n<p>An easy case can be found in the <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#replacing-whole-packages-forcing-their-removal\">Debian policy, 7.6.2 &ldquo;Replacing whole packages, forcing their removal&rdquo;</a>:</p>\n<p>If <code>B (= 2)</code> declares a <code>Conflicts: A (= 1)</code> and <code>Replaces: A (= 1)</code>, then the removal\nis valid. However this is incomplete as well, consider it declares <code>Conflicts: A (&lt; 1)</code>\nand <code>Replaces: A (&lt; 1)</code>; the solution to remove A rather than upgrade it would still\nbe wrong.</p>\n<p>This indicates that we should only allow removing <code>A</code> if the conflicts could not be solved\nby upgrading it.</p>\n<p>The other case to explore is package removals. If B is removed, A should be removed as well;\nhowever it there is another package X that <code>Provides: B (= 1)</code> and it is marked for install,\nA should not be removed. That said, the solver is not allowed to install X to satisfy the\ndepends <code>B (= 1)</code> - only to satisfy other dependencies [we do not want to get into endless\nloops where we switch between alternatives to keep reverse dependencies installed].</p>\n<h2 id=\"proposed-solution\">Proposed solution</h2>\n<p>To solve this, I propose the following definition:</p>\n<p><strong>Definition (sound removal)</strong>: A removal of package <code>P</code> is sound if either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A version <code>v</code> is installed that <em>package-conflicts</em> with B.</li>\n<li>A package <code>Q</code> is removed and the installable versions of P <em>package-depends</em> on Q.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>where the other definitions are:</p>\n<p><strong>Definition (installable version)</strong>: A version <code>v</code> is installable if either it is installed,\nor it is newer than an installed version of the same package (you may wish to change this to\naccomodate downgrades, or require strict pinning, but here be dragons).</p>\n<p><strong>Definition (package-depends):</strong> A version <code>v</code> <em>package-depends</em> on a package B if either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>there exists a dependency in <code>v</code> that can be solved by any version of <code>B</code>, or</li>\n<li>there exists a package <code>C</code> where <code>v package-depends C</code> and <code>any (c in C) package-depends B</code> (transitivity)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Definition (package-conflicts):</strong> A version <code>v</code> <em>package-conflicts</em> with an installed package <code>B</code> if either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>it declares a conflicts against an installable version of B; or</li>\n<li>there exists a package <code>C</code> where <code>v package-conflicts C</code>,\nand <code>b package-depends C</code> for installable versions b.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"translating-this-into-a-modified-sat-solver\">Translating this into a (modified) SAT solver</h2>\n<p>One approach may be to implement the logic in the conflict analysis that drives backtracking, i.e.\nwe assume a package <code>A</code> and when we reach <code>not A</code>, we analyse if the implication graph for <code>not A</code>\nconstitutes a sound removal, and then replace the assumption <code>A</code> with the assumption\n<code>A or &quot;learned reason</code>.</p>\n<p>However, while this seems a plausible mechanism for a DPLL solver, for a modern CDCL solver,  it&rsquo;s\nnot immediately evident how to analyse whether <code>not A</code> is sound if the reason for it is a learned\nclause, rather than a problem clause.</p>\n<p>Instead we propose a static encoding of the rules into a slightly modified SAT solver:</p>\n<p>Given c1, &hellip;, cn that transitive-conflicts A and D1, &hellip;, Dn that A package-depends on,\nintroduce the rule:</p>\n<p><code>A unless c1 or c2 or  ... cn ... or not D1 or not D2 ... or not Dn</code></p>\n<p>Rules of the form <code>A... unless B...</code> - where <code>A...</code> and <code>B...</code> are CNF - are\nintuitively the same as <code>A... or B...</code>, however the semantic here is different:\nWe are not allowed to select <code>B...</code> to satisfy this clause.</p>\n<p>This requires a SAT solver that tracks a reason for each literal being assigned,\nsuch as solver3, rather than a SAT solver like MiniSAT that only tracks reasons across\npropagation (solver3 may track <code>A depends B or C</code> as the reason for <code>B</code> without evaluating\n<code>C</code>, whereas MiniSAT would only track it as the reason given <code>not C</code>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-it-actually-sound\">Is it actually sound?</h2>\n<p>The proposed definition of a sound removal may still proof unsound as I either missed\nsomething in the conclusion of the proposed definition that violates my goal I set out\nto achieve, or I missed some of the goals.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to find cases that cause removals that look wrong :D</p>",

Ubuntu Summit was created from the dust of the Ubuntu Developer Summit in 2022 to recognize the community. It no longer serves that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As many know, I have been the lead of Ubuntu Studio for more than 7 years. I&#8217;m the longest-tenured Ubuntu Studio lead. I owe much of the foundation that was built to my predecessors: Luke Yelavich (founder), Scott Lavender, Kaj Ailomaa, and Set Halstrom. It is a true labor of love for me, and is the foundation for much of what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have worked myself through the ranks of Ubuntu, becoming a small-time packager for a small set of Ubuntu packages, then the Ubuntu Studio packageset, moving up to MOTU (Master of the Universe). I also served on the Ubuntu Community Council and am a current Discourse moderator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and the love of people is a huge motivation for me. Granted, for those first four years, I hadn&#8217;t ever met the people I was collaborating with to make Ubuntu Studio what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in August 2022, I was invited to attend the first ever Ubuntu Summit 2022 in Prague, Czechia. Having never travelled abroad before and never having even been off the continent of North America, itself a challenge as getting a U.S. passport is neither cheap nor easy, I was reluctant at first. Then I managed to get my passport, as well as the funds and passports to bring my wife and son to Ubuntu Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That experience changed my life and the life of my entire family. My son, 10 at the time, was the youngest registered attendee. My wife was inspired to bring back Edubuntu, which had been defunct for nine long years by the time it was revived that following spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the things that happen when you have personal connections with people. If you&#8217;ve never read the book before, I encourage you to read <em><a href=\"https://www.nurturingparenting.com/images/cmsfiles/hardwired_to_connect.pdf\">Hardwired to Connect</a></em>, which is a research paper published by a bunch of scientists. In essence, it says that people&#8217;s brains are wired, from birth, to engage in communities in for personal, in-person connections. It&#8217;s a scientific study that took years and is an excellent introduction to why we are the way we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of my education revolves around the very idea of building personal communities, which is one reason I was appalled when Ubuntu Summit, starting with 25.10, while it would be twice a year, it would be online-only except for the speakers. Having spoken at the past three, I was planning to take a year off from speaking, while still being there to represent as an Ubuntu Flavor Lead with my wife, also a now Flavor Lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it weren&#8217;t for that initial Ubuntu Summit, in person, my wife and son would not have been as interested or as involved as they are today. The subsequent years only strengthened that involvement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it&#8217;s going to be an online-focused approach. I get it. It&#8217;s cheaper and easier. Also, those attending online were just watching a livestream anyhow. The Local Communities (LoCos) can get together on their own if they want to do a big event. It&#8217;s easier to reach more people if you do everything online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Except it&#8217;s not.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the nearest active LoCo to me, in the Seattle-Tacoma area, is the Southern California LoCo. Meetups with them are logistically impossible. Same if I were to go to the Arizona LoCo; it&#8217;s just not possible. Most of the states in the United States are huge, so if there were one LoCo per state, it wouldn&#8217;t be correct. To be honest, I have no desire, time, or energy left to start and lead a LoCo in my area. Besides that, there used to be one for my state, but it&#8217;s long gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, with the exception of me and my wife, us flavor leads are scattered to the globe. It used to be that we would meet online throughout the year every other month and then meet together once a year at Ubuntu Summit. That&#8217;s gone now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I get it. Canonical is a company that is and always has been majority remote work. Except for one thing: they get together <strong>twice a year</strong> in-person, and are even given T-Shirts to celebrate the immediately-prior release <em>which was partially built by volunteers</em>. Those of us who give our time, energy, and effort to the Ubuntu community aren&#8217;t given that in-person experience, let alone a T-Shirt. The very lifeblood of what makes Ubuntu so great isn&#8217;t given the ability to meet in-person. That&#8217;s been stripped from us, and it came as a complete surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not without ideas for solutions to problems, though. Rather than be completely destructive in this post, I can be constructive. My solution to this would be a compromise:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have the Summit be in-person once a year following the <code>yy.04</code> release\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Have that one go back to being what it was. It can either have booths like 2024 did or go back to being talk/workshop-focused like years prior. It doesn&#8217;t matter, <strong>it just needs to be in-person</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have the Summit be online once a year following the <code>yy.10</code> release</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think this is too much to ask. The reward of personal connections when doing something remote for most of the year is a small price to pay, no matter the cost. Personal connections are tantamount to a healthy community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my compromise would prevent the Summit from dying just like the Ubuntu Developer Summit did once it went online-only. The way I see it is with the current status-quo, history is repeating itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure people at Canonical don&#8217;t see it this way because they meet with the people they work with the most twice a year. Those of us from the Ubuntu community that are developers aren&#8217;t given that luxury. We&#8217;re not even given that luxury once a year now. We&#8217;re not even given a T-Shirt!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Am I angry? A little. Do I feel betrayed by the very community I have given so much to over the years? Absolutely. Either way, I believe an online-only Summit is anti-collaborative in that it removes personal connections from the equation, which goes against the very fiber of my being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this, and I hope this reaches the people I&#8217;m trying to reach and have it speak for those who either won&#8217;t speak-up or don&#8217;t think they can make a difference.</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>It was the turn of the millenium when I got my first computer fresh at university.  Windows seemed uninteresting, it was impossible to work out how it worked or write programs for it.  SuSE Linux 6.2 was much more interesting to try and opened a world of understanding how computers worked and wanting to code on them.  These were the days of the .com boom and I went to big expos in London where they showered you with freebies and IBM competed with SuSE and Red Hat for the biggest stall.  IBM said that Linux had made it on the server and now was going to take over the desktop so I realised that working with KDE would be a good idea.  And as a novice coder it was very perfect for learning Qt and how open development worked and I loved the free software ideals.  Going to the pre-Akademy conference (it was called Kastle then) in Nove Hrady was a great intro to the community in person and in some ways I learnt more about software development in a week there then my years at uni.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So clearly this was a good way to make a career.  I dossed around for a year until the Quaker geek collective heard tale of an African Spaceman who was funding a new Linux distro called SSDS (Shuttleworth&#8217;s Super Secret Debian Startup) so I got into Debian packaging and made a point that KDE should be involved.  Before long they came knocking and I went to the first Ubuntu conference in Australia.  I spent about ten amazing years brining KDE to Ubuntu or bringing Ubuntu to KDE for what was already called Kubuntu (not my name choice), a successful community project I&#8217;m really proud of.  At one point Nokia wanted to use it alongside Plasma Active to sell on a tablet thing along with phones, this could well have taken over the world but y&#8217;know, iPhone happened and Kubuntu never found a commercial use after that although it still gets used in big places like Google or the City of Munich or Weta digital (watch those Hobbit DVD extras).  I loved being invited out to Nigeria or India to give talks and spread the world of open software.  Looking back there&#8217;s probably a million business cases that would have been possible but I&#8217;m not the best at being a future visionary.  Eventually Canonical decided to stop funding it which is fair enough.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then Blue Systems came along, another nice guy with deep pockets wanting to help and we carried on.  When Canonical decided to kill off lots of community projects we came up with the idea of moving directly into KDE to make KDE neon.  It has always been crazy how open source communities like KDE are reliant on separate companies to take their software out to the world so we wanted to change that, and I like to think we succeeded.  Using CI systems we could create a much more manageable setup.  Still the system was never as resiliant as it should have been and several times KDE neon ended up shipping a duff update which will have been very painful for users.  We had three people working full time on it at the start but before long it was just me and a volunteer and the quality suffered as a result.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last winter I drove to the Blue Systems schoße for a routine conference and was organising people to give talks when the guy who pays us started off by saying he was dying and the company would be shutting down.  Which was very sad but it makes sense to end it on a high.  After years of having no business modal and not knowing what the aims of the company were, which caused several people to genuinely go mad, we finally had a business model of sorts with Valve paying us to make Plasma up to the standards needed to ship it as Desktop Scope on the Valve Steam Deck games console.  Nate had been given advanced notice of the company shutting down and had already started another company, Tech Paladin, to take on the business.  Shouldn&#8217;t this be run as a cooperative we wondered?  No that was too complex he said.  The next day I ended up at a funeral for some German accountants and when I came back there had been some more discussion and we watched a video about Igalia who make the other operating system for Valve.  They are a cooperative socialist paradise and Nate said he&#8217;d look into doing that instead of the setup where he had full control and all the profit.  It was clear there was to be no other discussion on the matter of our future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few weeks later we had an online meeting where I proposed a useful agenda but was ignored, instead Nate gave his updated plan for a business which was to give Dave a slice of the profit and otherwise he&#8217;d keep all the profit and all the control.  So I gave my proposal I&#8217;d been working on for a company with equal ownership, equal profit, a management structure and workers rights.  A couple weeks later we had anther video call but Nate called me first and told me I&#8217;d be excluded from it.  No explanation was given beyond I had &#8220;made some comments and would not be happy&#8221;.  If someone is telling you what your emotions that is when controlling behaviour starts to become abusive.  And thus ended my 25 years with KDE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what of my colleagues?  Surely they wouldn&#8217;t want a setup where they have no control over their professional life and all their profit goes to one person?  Well dunno, they&#8217;ve stopped speaking to me.  Nothing.  Silence.  Nil.  Not so much as a &#8220;cheereo&#8221;, nor &#8220;sorry we chose the option were you got excluded&#8221; and certainly no explanation.  From people who I have worked with for some twenty years in some cases that hurts.  I don&#8217;t know why they stopped talking to me, I can only speculate and I don&#8217;t want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We never had workers rights at Blue Systems, we were all on self employment contracts.  This will continue at Tech Paladin.  It is illegal but unenforceable when done on an international setup.  But employment rights are not a luxury you can chose to do without if you enjoy your job and want some more flexibility in your work day.  They are fundamental and life altering rights that change people&#8217;s lives as I discovered when my adopted children were taken away from me.  Nobody should be doing business with or taking money from Tech Paladin else be party to illegal workers rights abuses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I started to get sad, being cut off from my life for the last 25 years was too much for me.  All things come to an end and I&#8217;ve seen plenty people had to leave KDE because the money ran out or maybe they had a disagreement with someone in the project, but never a profiteering control struggle like this.  I struggled to get out of bed on some days.  I&#8217;ve given my life to KDE, I&#8217;ve seen it gone from a sure fire project to take over the world to being one open desktop project in a world of many to seeing the revival in recent years where we can honestly say we make some of the best software out there.  I like to think I&#8217;ve been part of keeping it alive, progressing, relevant and at the forefront of commercial, government and community usage.  It&#8217;s been an amazing ride full of opportunities and adventures the likes of which I&#8217;m sure my peers from my university course have never had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the end I lost my friends, my colleagues, my job, my career and my family.  What&#8217;s a spod who just tried to do the right thing for society to do?  Dunno.  For now, if you want me, you can find me surfing the endless wave whenever the sun sets over my digital nomad coliving paddleshack at the end of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLEwUpT5DUc\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"859\" src=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1024x859.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1610\" srcset=\"https://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1024x859.png 1024w, https://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-300x252.png 300w, https://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-768x644.png 768w, https://jriddell.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image.png 1118w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLEwUpT5DUc\">Sunset surfs at the digital nomad coliving paddleshack at the end of the world</a></figcaption></figure>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>About two years ago I wrote a Rust crate to fulfill this promise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a crash occurs while updating a file, the file either contains the old\ncontents, or the new contents, nothing in between.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This crate essentially solves the following problem: when you update a file,\ngenerally you open it, truncate it, write to it block-by-block, and eventually\nclose it. The problem with this process is that if a crash occurs at any point\nduring this process (the program segfaults, the kernel panics, the machine\nloses power, …), your file will be left in an intermediate state where the\nold contents are completely lost, and the new contents are only partially\nwritten (if at all). My crate solves this problem by making file updates <em>atomic</em>.</p>\n<p>This crate is publicly available as <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/atomic-write-file\">atomic-write-file</a> and you can read its\ndescription for more details (sorry, I’m very bad at naming things).</p>\n<p>The way the crate works is simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of opening the <em>target</em> file directly, the crate opens a <em>temporary</em>\n   file.</li>\n<li>You write to the temporary file.</li>\n<li>Once all changes are in, the temporary file contents are synced to the\n   storage, and it is atomically renamed so that it replaces the target file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is not by any chance a new technique that I invented, and it’s a very\ncommon strategy to solve the problem. This technique guarantees that if a crash\noccurs at or before step 3, then the file will have the old contents,\nunchanged. If a crash occurs after step 3, then the file will have the new\ncontents.</p>\n<p>There’s a small caveat with this technique: if a crash occurs between steps 1\nand 3, then the crate will leave behind a temporary file that occupies some\nspace on the storage device with no purpose.</p>\n<p>This is where Linux anonymous temporary files come into play: this\nLinux-specific feature allows you to create temporary files that are written on\nthe filesystem, but are not given a path in the filesystem. If a crash occurs\nbetween step 1 and 3, the temporary file will simply be forgotten into\noblivion.</p>\n<h1 id=\"meet-the-opponent-btrfs\">Meet the opponent: btrfs</h1>\n<p>Using Linux anonymous temporary files seemed very appealing for\natomic-write-file to avoid leaving leftovers behind, although I knew that\nthey’re not the perfect solution: there’s limited support (they’re supported\nonly on Linux, and only on some filesystems), they require the use of Linux\nfeatures that may not be available all the time (the <code>/proc</code> filesystem), and\nthey also have the problem that, sooner or later, they will need to be given a\nname if we want to be able to replace the target file, and this leaves a small\ntime window during which we could leave some cruft behind.</p>\n<p>But none of these are huge problems, and in fact atomic-write-file is able to\ndo a best effort attempt at using anonymous temporary files, and reverting to\nregular files if that doesn’t work.</p>\n<p>One day I was notified about <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/issues/6\">an issue on using my crate on the btrfs file\nsystem</a>: after a crash, my crate could break its promise and leave the\nfile contents <strong>empty</strong>. I did some investigation on the issue that <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/issues/6#issuecomment-2048836275\">you can\nread about if you’re interested</a>, and then fixed it.</p>\n<p>This problem was specific to btrfs, and I argue that it’s actually caused by a\nbtrfs bug, rather than a bug in the crate itself, but nonetheless this issue\nhad revealed a critical flaw of my crate: <strong>I did not have any tests to check\nif my crate was fulfilling its promise or not!</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore I decided to create a small test suite for Linux to simulate crashes\nand inspect the contents of files after those crashes occurred on a variety of\nfilesystems, which is what this blog post is about. This test suite now runs on\nmy laptop and <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/actions/workflows/crash-tests.yml\">on GitHub Actions</a>, and potentially any\nother CI environment.</p>\n<h1 id=\"testing-strategy\">Testing strategy</h1>\n<p>Here’s the idea I came up with: I can create a virtual machine, with a virtual\nstorage device attached to it, and a filesystem initialized with a file. The\nvirtual machine updates the file using atomic-write-file, and then triggers a\nkernel panic. After that, the file is inspected for consistency.</p>\n<p>So here is how it works in practice: there are 3 main pieces:\n1. A test binary that is responsible for updating the test file using\n   atomic-write-file.\n1. An <code>init.sh</code> script that runs inside the virtual machine.\n1. The <code>run-tests.sh</code> script that puts everything together and starts up the\n   virtual machine.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-test-binary\">The test binary</h2>\n<p>The test binary that is a <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/blob/master/crash-tests/linux/src/main.rs\">short Rust program</a> that I can paste here:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">atomic_write_file</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">AtomicWriteFile</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">std</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">io</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">Write</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">fn</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">main</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">mut</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AtomicWriteFile</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;/test/file&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"n\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;open failed&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">write_all</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">b&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"n\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;write failed&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">file</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">commit</span><span class=\"p\">().</span><span class=\"n\">expect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;commit failed&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Nothing special to see here: this is the minimal code required to use atomic-write-file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-initsh-script\">The init.sh script</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/blob/master/crash-tests/linux/init.sh\">The <code>init.sh</code> script</a> is more interesting: this script in fact is meant to run\n<em>twice</em>. The first time it runs, <code>init.sh</code> will run the test binary above and\ntrigger the kernel panic. The second time, it will read the test file contents\nand report them back <code>run-tests.sh</code> script for inspection.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at what it does: first, it mounts the <code>/proc</code> and\n<code>/sys</code> virtual filesystems. These are needed for some basic system functions,\nand also to enable the Linux anonymous temporary file feature.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>mount<span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span>proc<span class=\"w\"> </span>none<span class=\"w\"> </span>/proc\nmount<span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span>sysfs<span class=\"w\"> </span>none<span class=\"w\"> </span>/sys\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then it mounts the filesystem containing the test file. Before it can do that,\nhowever, it needs to load the correct kernel module for the filesystem. Nothing\ntoo fancy here: the filesystem type is simply specified on the kernel command\nline (read through <code>/proc/cmdline</code>):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">fstype</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>grep<span class=\"w\"> </span>-Eo<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;test.fs=\\w+&#39;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>/proc/cmdline<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>cut<span class=\"w\"> </span>-d<span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-f2<span class=\"k\">)</span>\nmodprobe<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$fstype</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">||</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">true</span>\nmount<span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$fstype</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>/dev/sdb<span class=\"w\"> </span>/test\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then, if this script is run for the first time, it will run the test executable and quit:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;Running test binary&#39;</span>\natomic-write-file-test\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p><code>init.sh</code> (as the name suggests) is run as the init script of the virtual\nmachine. In Linux, if the init script quits without invoking the proper\nshutdown sequence, the kernel will panic. So we don’t actually need to do\nanything special to trigger a panic. I could have inserted a <code>echo c &gt;\n/proc/sysrq-trigger</code> line to make it more explicit, but then I figured that\nhaving that line wouldn’t be nice for people who want to test the script on\ntheir system.</p>\n<p>You might ask: how does <code>init.sh</code> know if it’s the first time it gets called or\nthe second? Again, nothing fancy here: <code>run-tests.sh</code> gives that hint using a\nkernel command line argument:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>grep<span class=\"w\"> </span>-q<span class=\"w\"> </span>test.verify<span class=\"w\"> </span>/proc/cmdline<span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\"># ...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>If <code>test.verify</code> is specified on <code>/proc/cmdline</code>, then it means this is the\nsecond time this script is run. In that case, the file contents are just\nprinted on the console:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>grep<span class=\"w\"> </span>-q<span class=\"w\"> </span>test.verify<span class=\"w\"> </span>/proc/cmdline<span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;Verifying test file contents&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;-----&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>xxd<span class=\"w\"> </span>/test/file\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;-----&#39;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>poweroff<span class=\"w\"> </span>-f\n<span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This uses <code>xxd</code> so in case there are garbled characters on screen, we can\ncomfortably analyze the output and figure out what happened. At the end, the\nsystem is more gracefully shut down using <code>poweroff</code> to avoid another kernel\npanic (this is not really necessary).</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-run-testssh-script\">The run-tests.sh script</h1>\n<p>And then there’s <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/blob/master/crash-tests/linux/run-test.sh\">the <code>run-tests.sh</code> script that crates the virtual storage,\nlaunches the virtual machine, and inspects the file contents</a>.\nThis is where most the complexity is, so let’s go step-by-step (the code below\nhas been simplified from the original for readability):</p>\n<p>The first thing it does is compiling the test binary above. The virtual machine\nruns in a very barebone environment, so I used static linking to avoid having\nto copy additional libraries like <code>libc</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">target</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>uname<span class=\"w\"> </span>-m<span class=\"k\">)</span>-unknown-linux-gnu\n<span class=\"nv\">RUSTFLAGS</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;-C target-feature=+crt-static&#39;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>cargo<span class=\"w\"> </span>build<span class=\"w\"> </span>--release<span class=\"w\"> </span>--features<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$cargo_features</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>--target<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$target</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Then <code>run-tests.sh</code> creates a minimal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk\">initramfs</a> for the virtual machine. The\ninitramfs is a filesystem that gets mounted by Linux early at boot. It’s\ngenerally used by Linux distributions to load the main operating system, but in\nmy case the initramfs contains everything needed for the test. In particular,\nit contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The test binary.</li>\n<li>The <code>init.sh</code> script.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox\">BusyBox</a>, to get the needed utilities like <code>xxd</code> and <code>poweroff</code>.</li>\n<li>The kernel modules to mount filesystems and their dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first 3 items are easy to set up:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code>cp<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;init.sh&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-T<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">/sbin/init&quot;</span>\ncp<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;atomic-write-file-test&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">/bin&quot;</span>\ncp<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>which<span class=\"w\"> </span>busybox<span class=\"k\">)</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">/bin&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$busybox</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>--install<span class=\"w\"> </span>-s<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">/bin&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The kernel modules are a bit more complicated. First of all: where can we get\nthem from? Ideally, I would have liked to download them from some minimal Linux\ndistribution, but this turned out to be more complicated than expected. In the\nend, I decided to just steal them from the host operating system:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">modules</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>/usr/lib/modules/<span class=\"k\">$(</span>uname<span class=\"w\"> </span>-r<span class=\"k\">)</span>\ncp<span class=\"w\"> </span>-a<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$modules</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-t<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">/lib/modules&quot;</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">while</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">read</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-r<span class=\"w\"> </span>mod_path<span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">do</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[[</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>*.ko.gz<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">]]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span>gunzip<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-o<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">.uncompressed&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">elif</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[[</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>*.ko.xz<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">]]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span>unxz<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-o<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">.uncompressed&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">elif</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[[</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>*.ko.zst<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">]]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span>unzstd<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-o<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">.uncompressed&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">else</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">continue</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>mv<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">.uncompressed&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$mod_path</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">done</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>&lt;<span class=\"w\"> </span>&lt;<span class=\"o\">(</span>modprobe<span class=\"w\"> </span>--dirname<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>--show-depends<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$filesystem_type</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>grep<span class=\"w\"> </span>^insmod<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>cut<span class=\"w\"> </span>-d<span class=\"s1\">&#39; &#39;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>-f2<span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>What this does is copying all the module files from the host, getting all the\ndependencies for the filesystem module using <code>modprobe</code>, and then uncompressing\nthose modules if they’re compressed (I found this much easier than adding\ncompression support in the virtual machine). An alternative approach would be\nto simply decompress all the modules, but that’s much slower.</p>\n<p>Once everything has been copied over and uncompressed, the initramfs is\ncreated:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">initramfs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>rootfs.img\nmksquashfs<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs_build_dir</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Now it’s time to create the virtual storage device with the filesystem, which\nis a trivial task:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">testfs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>testfs.img\ndd<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>/dev/zero<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">of</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$testfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">bs</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>1M<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nv\">count</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"m\">300</span>\n<span class=\"s2\">&quot;mkfs.</span><span class=\"nv\">$filesystem_type</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$testfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Finally, we can start our VM using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU\">QEMU</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">qemu</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>qemu-system-<span class=\"k\">$(</span>uname<span class=\"w\"> </span>-m<span class=\"k\">)</span>\n<span class=\"nv\">kernel</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>/boot/vmlinuz-<span class=\"k\">$(</span>uname<span class=\"w\"> </span>-r<span class=\"k\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$qemu</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-kernel<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$kernel</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-append<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;root=/dev/sda ro panic=-1 console=ttyS0 quiet test.fs=</span><span class=\"nv\">$filesystem_type</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-drive<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;index=0,media=disk,format=raw,file=</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-drive<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;index=1,media=disk,format=raw,file=</span><span class=\"nv\">$testfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-no-reboot<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-nographic\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Again we’re stealing the kernel from the host operating system, which is also\nwhere the kernel modules come from. The <code>drive</code> with <code>index=0</code> is the initramfs\nand will be visible as <code>/dev/sda</code> in the guest; the other drive with <code>index=1</code>\nis our test storage and will be visible as <code>/dev/sdb</code>.</p>\n<p><code>root=/dev/sda</code> tells the kernel to boot from our initramfs image. <code>panic=-1</code>\ntells the kernel not to reboot in case of a panic (<code>panic=N</code> specifies the\nnumber of seconds to wait before rebooting in case of kernel panic; specifying\na negative value blocks that behavior). <code>console=ttyS0</code> allows us to capture\nthe output printed by the init script. <code>test.fs=...</code> is the option that\n<code>init.sh</code> is going to look for to understand what filesystem type to use.</p>\n<p>Once that runs, the virtual machine is expected to do its job and crash with a\nkernel panic. We then need to restart it to verify the file contents. The QEMU\ncommand is exactly the same except for the additional <code>test.verify</code> option:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nv\">output</span><span class=\"o\">=</span>output.txt\n\n<span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$qemu</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-kernel<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$kernel</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-append<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;root=/dev/sda ro panic=-1 console=ttyS0 quiet test.fs=</span><span class=\"nv\">$filesystem_type</span><span class=\"s2\"> test.verify&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-drive<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;index=0,media=disk,format=raw,file=</span><span class=\"nv\">$initramfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-drive<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;index=1,media=disk,format=raw,file=</span><span class=\"nv\">$testfs</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-no-reboot<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span>-nographic<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"p\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>tee<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$output</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The output from this command is captured in a file that can be analyzed. If you\nremember how <code>init.sh</code> is written, you might have noticed that it writes the\ntest file contents between two markers:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;-----&#39;</span>\nxxd<span class=\"w\"> </span>/test/file\n<span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;-----&#39;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>So what we have to do to verify the contents of the file is simply look for\nthose two <code>-----</code> markers, get the content in between, and parse it through\n<code>xxd -r</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">[[</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">$(</span>sed<span class=\"w\"> </span>-n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;/-----/, /-----/p&#39;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"nv\">$output</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">|</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>xxd<span class=\"w\"> </span>-r<span class=\"k\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span>hello<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">]]</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">then</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Success&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">echo</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;Failure&quot;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"nb\">exit</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"m\">1</span>\n<span class=\"k\">fi</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>And that’s it!</p>\n<h1 id=\"running-in-github-actions\">Running in GitHub Actions</h1>\n<p>The next step for me was to set up some automation to make sure that my test\nscript was run whenever I made any change to the crate. Because my project was\nalready hosted on GitHub, I decided to go with GitHub Actions. I was a bit\nworried that I would have had to struggle to make it work because my script\nworks by <em>stealing</em> the kernel from the host, and I thought that the GitHub\nrunners could have some protections in place to prevent me from reading the\nkernel. To my surprise, there were no such restrictions. In fact, I did not\nhave to modify a single line of code to make my tests work in GitHub Actions:\ncheck out the <a href=\"https://github.com/andreacorbellini/rust-atomic-write-file/blob/master/.github/workflows/crash-tests.yml\">workflow file</a> if you’re curious.</p>\n<h1 id=\"result\">Result</h1>\n<p>In the end, the test suite was able to reproduce the issue with btrfs and\nanonymous temporary files, as well as show that the fix was working as\nintended. This is what it looks like (output in the screenshot was trimmed down\na bit):</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://andrea.corbellini.name/images/crash-tests-failure.png\" alt=\"Output showing a failure from the test suite\">\n  <figcaption>Output from the <code>run-test.sh</code> script <em>before</em> applying the fix, showing a failure.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://andrea.corbellini.name/images/crash-tests-success.png\" alt=\"Output showing a success from the test suite\">\n  <figcaption>Output from the <code>run-test.sh</code> script <em>after</em> applying the fix, showing a success.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h1 id=\"future\">Future</h1>\n<p>I’m pretty satisfied with the general approach of running in a virtual machine\nand simulating a crash, but the implementation has a huge limitation: because\nit <em>steals</em> the kernel from the host, it cannot simulate crashes on other\nkernels, operating systems, or platforms.</p>\n<p>I think in the future I’m going to take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/cross-rs/cross\">cross-rs</a>, a cross-platform\ntool for Rust crates. Cross-rs works kinda in a similar way as my test suite,\nin that it uses QEMU emulation to run tests. Maybe I can reuse their QEMU\nimages and tweak them to run my crash tests. If that is feasible, then I will\nbe able to extend my test suite to all major platforms and operating systems.</p>",

In cases when FIPS cryptography is required, additional burden would be placed onto these systems to operate their kernels in FIPS mode.</p><p><a href=\"https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/\">Trusted Computing Group</a>&nbsp;works on establishing many industry standards and specifications, which are widely adopted to improve safety and security of computing whilst keeping it easy to use. One of their most famous specifications them is TCG&nbsp;<span face=\"Roboto-Medium\" style=\"background-color: white;\">TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module). TPMs are now widely available on most devices and help to protect secret keys and attest systems. For example, most software full disk encryption solutions can utilise TCG TPM to store full disk encryption keys providing passwordless, biometric or pin-base ways to unlock the drives as well as attesting that system have not been modified or compromised whilst offline.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/storage-work-group-storage-security-subsystem-class-opal/\">TCG Storage Security Subsystem Class: Opal Specification</a>&nbsp;is a set of specifications for features of data storage devices. The authors and contributors to OPAL are leading and well trusted storage manufacturers such as Samsung, Western Digital, Seagate Technologies, Dell, Google, Lenovo, IBM, Kioxia, among others. One of the features that Opal Specification enables is self-encrypting drives which becomes very powerful when combined with pre-boot authentication. Out of the box, such drives always and transparently encrypt all disk data using hardware acceleration. To protect data one can enter UEFI firmware setup (BIOS) to set NVMe single user password (or user + administrator/recovery passwords) to encrypt the disk encryption key. If one's firmware didn't come with such features, one can also use <a href=\"https://sedutil.com/\">SEDutil</a>&nbsp;to inspect and configure all of this. Latest release of major Linux distributions have SEDutil already packaged.</p><p>Once password is set, on startup, pre-boot authentication will request one to enter password - prior to booting any operating systems. It means that full disk is actually encrypted, including the UEFI ESP and all operating systems that are installed in case of dual or multi-boot installations. This also prevents tampering with ESP, UEFI bootloaders and kernels which with traditional software-based encryption often remain unencrypted and accessible. It also means one doesn't have to do special OS level repartitioning, or installation steps to ensure all data is encrypted at rest.</p><p>What about FIPS compliance? Well, the good news is that majority of the OPAL compliant hard drives and/or security sub-chips do have FIPS 140-3 certification. Meaning they have been tested by independent laboratories to ensure they do in-fact encrypt data. On the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search\">CMVP</a> website one can search for module name terms \"OPAL\" or \"NVMe\" or name of hardware vendor to locate FIPS certificates.</p><p>Are such drives widely available? Yes. For example, a common Thinkpad X1 gen 11 has OPAL NVMe drives as standard, and they have FIPS certification too. Thus, it is likely in your hardware fleet these are already widely available. Use sedutil to check if MediaEncrypt and LockingSupported features are available.</p><p>Well, this is great for laptops and physical servers, but you may ask - what about public or private cloud? Actually, more or less the same is already in-place in both. On CVMP website all major clouds have their disk encryption hardware certified, and all of them always encrypt all Virtual Machines with FIPS certified cryptography without an ability to opt-out. One is however in full control of how the encryption keys are managed: cloud-provider or self-managed (either with a cloud HSM or KMS or bring your own / external). See these relevant encryption options and key management docs for <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption?hl=en\">GCP</a>, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disk-encryption-overview\">Azure</a>, <a href=\"https://maturitymodel.security.aws.dev/en/2.-foundational/kms/\">AWS</a>. But the key takeaway without doing anything, at rest, VMs in public cloud are always encrypted and satisfy NIST SP 800-53 controls.</p><p>What about private cloud? Most Linux based private clouds ultimately use <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">qemu</a>&nbsp;typically with qcow2 virtual disk images. Qemu supports user-space encryption of qcow2 disk, see this <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/tools/qemu-img.html\">manpage</a>. Such encryption encrypts the full virtual machine disk, including the bootloader and ESP. And it is handled entirely outside of the VM on the host - meaning the VM never has access to the disk encryption keys. Qemu implements this encryption entirely in userspace using gnutls, nettle, libgcrypt depending on how it was compiled. This also means one can satisfy FIPS requirements entirely in userspace without a Linux kernel in FIPS mode. Higher level APIs built on top of qemu also support qcow2 disk encryption, as in projects such as <a href=\"https://libvirt.org/formatstorageencryption.html\">libvirt</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/latest/configuration/block-storage/volume-encryption.html\">OpenStack Cinder</a>.</p><p>If you carefully read the docs, you may notice that agent support is explicitly sometimes called out as not supported or not mentioned. Quite often agents running inside the OS may not have enough observability to them to assess if there is external encryption. It does mean that monitoring above encryption options require different approaches - for example monitor your cloud configuration using tools such as Wiz and <a href=\"https://orca.security/\">Orca</a>, rather than using agents inside individual VMs. For laptop / endpoint security agents, I do wish they would start gaining capability to report OPAL SED availability and status if it is active or not.</p><p>What about using software encryption none-the-less on top of the above solutions? It is commonly referred to double or multiple encryption. There will be an additional performance impact, but it can be worthwhile. It really depends on what you define as data at rest for yourself and which controls you need. If one has a dual-boot laptop, and wants to keep one OS encrypted whilst booted into the other, it can perfectly reasonable to encrypted the two using separate software encryption keys. In addition to the OPAL encryption of the ESP. For more targeted per-file / per-folder encryption, one can look into using <a href=\"https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/\">gocryptfs</a>&nbsp;which is the best successor to the once popular, but now deprecated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ecryptfs.org/\">eCryptfs</a>&nbsp;(amazing tool, but has fallen behind in development and can lead to data loss).</p><p>All of the above mostly talks about cryptographic encryption, which only provides confidentially but not data integrity. To protect integrity, one needs to choose how to maintain that. <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/verity.html\">dm-verity</a> is a good choice for read-only and rigid installations. For read-write workloads, it may be easier to deploy <a href=\"https://zfsonlinux.org/\">ZFS</a> or <a href=\"https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\">Btrfs</a>&nbsp;instead. If one is using filesystems without a built-in integrity support such as XFS or Ext4, one can retrofit integrity layer to them by using <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-integrity.html\">dm-integrity</a>&nbsp;(either standalone, or via dm-luks/cryptsetup --integrity option).</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If one has a lot of estate and a lot of encryption keys to keep track off a key management solution is likely needed. The most popular solution is likely the one from Thales Group marketed under <a href=\"https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/data-security-platform\">ChiperTrust Data Security Platform</a> (previously Vormetric), but there are many others including OEM / Vendor / Hardware / Cloud specific or agnostic solutions.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">I hope this crash course guide piques your interest to learn and discover modern confidentially and integrity solutions, and to re-affirm or change your existing controls w.r.t. to data protection at rest.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Full disk encryption, including UEFI ESP /boot/efi is now widely achievable by default on both baremetal machines and in VMs including with FIPS certification.

I haven&#8217;t been able to find something as of yet, but it&#8217;s been a learning curve. The market is not what it has been in the last couple of years. With AI in the mix, lots of roles have been eliminated, or have shifted towards where human intervention is needed to interpret or verify the data AI is interpreting. Job hunting is a job in an of itself, and may even take a 9 to 5 role. I know of a lot of people who have gone through the same process as myself, and wanted to share some of insights and tips from what I&#8217;ve learned throughout the last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Leveraging your network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, and I think most important, is to understand that there&#8217;s a lot of great people around that you might have worked with. You can always ask for recommendations, touch base, or even have a small chat to see how things are going on their end. Conversations can be very refreshing, and can help you get a new perspective as how the industries are shifting, where you might want to learn new skills, or how to improve your positioning in the market. Folks can talk around and see if there&#8217;s additional positions where you might be a good fit, and it&#8217;s always good to have a helping hand (or a few). At the end of the day, these folks are your own community. I&#8217;ve gotten roles in the past by being referred, and these connections have been critical for my understanding of how different businesses may approach the same problem, or even to solve internal conflicts. So, reach out to people you know!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding the market</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I mentioned in the opening paragraph, the market is evolving constantly. AI has taken a very solid role nowadays, and lots of companies ask about how you&#8217;ve used AI recently. Part of understanding the market is understanding the bleeding edge tools that are used to improve workflows and day-to-day efficiency. Research tools that are coming up, and that are shaping the market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you an example. Haven&#8217;t tried AI yet? Give it a spin, even for simple questions. Understand where it works, where it fails, and how you, as a human, can make it work for you. Get a sense of the pitfalls, and where human intervention is needed to interpret or verify the data that&#8217;s in there. Like one of my former managers said, &#8220;trust, but verify&#8221;. Or, you can even get to the point of not trusting the data, and sharing that as a story!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apply thoughtfully</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone gave me the recommendation to apply to everything that I see where I &#8220;could be a fit&#8221;. While this might have its upsides, you might also end up in situations where you are not actually a fit, or where you don&#8217;t know the company and what it does. Always take the time, at least a few minutes, to understand the company that you&#8217;re applying for, research their values, and how they align to yours. Read about the product they&#8217;re creating, selling, or offering, and see if it&#8217;s a product where you could contribute your skills. Then, you can make the decision of applying. While doing this you may discover that you are applying to a position in a sector that you&#8217;re not interested in, or where your skillset might not be used to its full potential. And you might be missing out on some other opportunities that are significantly more aligned to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also take the time to fully review the job description. JDs are pretty descriptive, and you might stumble upon certain details that don&#8217;t align with yourself, such as the salary, hours, location, or certain expectations that you might feel don&#8217;t fit within the role or that you are not ready for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prepare for your interviews</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You landed an interview &#8211; congratulations! Make sure that you&#8217;ve researched the company before heading in. If you&#8217;ve taken a look at the company and the role before applying, take a glimpse again. You might find more interesting things, and it will demonstrate that you are actually preparing yourself for the interview. Also, interviewing is a two-way street. Make sure that you have some questions at the end. Double-check the role of your interviewer in the company, and ensure that you have questions that are tailored to their particular roles. Think about what you want to get from the interview (other than the job!).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Job sourcing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many great job sources today &#8211; LinkedIn being the biggest of all of them. Throughout my searches I&#8217;ve also found weworkremotely.com and hnhiring.com are great sources. I strongly advise that you expand your search and find sources that are relevant to your particular role or industry. This has opened up a lot of opportunities for me!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take some time for yourself</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that having a job is important. However, it&#8217;s also important to take time for yourself. Your mental health is important. You can use this time to develop some skills, play some games, take care of your garden, or even reorganize your home. Find a hobby and distract yourself every now and then. Take breaks, and ensure you&#8217;re not over-stressing yourself. Read a bit about burnout, and take care of yourself, as burnout can also happen from job hunting. And if you need a breather, make sure you take one, but don&#8217;t overdo it! Time is valuable, so it&#8217;s all about finding the right balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully this is helpful for some folks that are going through my same situation. What other things have worked for you? Do you have any other tips you could share? I&#8217;d be happy to read about them! Share them with me on <a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/joseantonio-rey\">LinkedIn</a>. I&#8217;m also happy to chat &#8211; you can always find me at jose@ubuntu.com.</p>",

In your new role we want you to create an educational flavor of Ubuntu, there will be a debian-edu/skolelinux gathering in Bergen in Norway from the 10th to 12th of June, are you okay flying there with Mark?&#8221;<br><br>I rushed back home and told my girlfriend: &#8220;I&#8217;m hired, and I&#8217;ll fly Canonical One on my first business trip next month!&#8221; (Canonical One was the name of Marks plane). I learned the next weeks that Canonical had indeed booked a generic scheduled flight for me and we&#8217;d only meet at the venue <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><br><br>The flight was a disaster, after we were boarding that small 20-seater 2 prop plane that was supposed to get us from Cologne to Amsterdam and the pilot started the engine my window all of a sudden was soaked in oil. We had to stay in the plane out on the filed while the mechanics were fixing the engine for like 2-3h so indeed I missed the connection in Amsterdam and had to stay for the night instead of arriving in Bergen the evening before the event started.<br><br>When I arrived at the venue everyone was already busy hacking on stuff and I jumped right in alongside, finally meeting some users of LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project) which I was upstream for at that time and working with them on the problems they faced in debian with it, tinkering with moodle as a teaching support system and looking at other edu software, meanwhile Mark was sitting on a bar-stool in a corner with his laptop hacking on launchpad code.<br><br>When we went to our hotel in the evening it turned out they did not have our booking at all and were completely overbooked due to a jewelry exhibition they had in the house for that week. I talked like 15min to the lady behind the counter, showed her my booking confirmation PDF on the laptop, begged and flirted a lot and eventually she told us &#8220;We do have an exhibition room that we keep as spare, it only has one bed but you can have it and we will add a folding bed&#8221;. The room was actually a normal hotel room but completely set up with wallpaper tables all around the walls. <br><br>Mark insisted to take the folding bed and I can tell you, he does not snore &#8230; (well, he didn&#8217;t back then)<br><br>This was only the first of a plethora of adventures that followed in the upcoming 20 years, that phone call clearly changed my life and the company gave me the opportunity to work with the brightest, sharpest and most intelligent people on the planet in and outside of Canonical.<br><br>It surely changed a lot over these years (when I started we were building the distro with 18 people in the distro team and did that for quite a few years before it actually got split into server, foundations, kernel and desktop teams) but it never lost its special spirit of having these exceptional people with such a high focus on bringing opensource to everyone and making it accessible to everyone. <br>Indeed, with growth comes the requirement to make more money to pay the people, the responsibility to give your employees a certain amount of security and persistence grows, but Canonical and especially Mark have always managed to keep the balance to not lose that focus and do the right thing in the end.<br><br>Ten years ago I said &#8220;onward to the next ten!!&#8221;, I won&#8217;t really say &#8220;onward to the next 20!&#8221; today, not because I ever plan to resign but simply because I doubt I still want to work full time when I&#8217;m 75 <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /><br><br>Thank you Mark for dragging me into this adventure and thank you for still having me! I still love the ride!!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>",

After the colon (<code>:</code>), you type <em>filter</em> keywords, and in this case we typed <code>desktop</code> to show images that have the word <code>desktop</code> in them (to show only Desktop images).

The configuration files for distrobuilder to create these images can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/lxc/lxc-ci/tree/main/images\">https://github.com/lxc/lxc-ci/tree/main/images</a> For example, the <code>archlinux.yaml</code> configuration file has a section to create the desktop image, along with the container and other virtual machine images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of Incus images are also available on the Web, through the website <a href=\"https://images.linuxcontainers.org/\">https://images.linuxcontainers.org/</a> It is possible to generate more such desktop images by following the steps of the existing configuration files. Perhaps a Kali Linux desktop image would be very useful. In the <a href=\"https://images.linuxcontainers.org/\">https://images.linuxcontainers.org/</a> website you can also view the build logs that were generated while building the images, and figure out what parameters are needed for <code>distrobuilder</code> to build them (along with the actual configuration file). For example, here are the logs for the ArchLinux desktop image, <a href=\"https://images.linuxcontainers.org/images/archlinux/current/amd64/desktop-gnome/\">https://images.linuxcontainers.org/images/archlinux/current/amd64/desktop-gnome/</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to this point we got a list of the available virtual machine images that are provided by Incus. We are ready to boot them.</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"booting-a-desktop-linux-vm-on-incus\">Booting a desktop Linux VM on Incus</h2>\n\n\n<p>When launching a VM, Incus provides by default 1GiB RAM and 10GiB of disk space. The disk space is generally OK, but the RAM is too little for a desktop image (it&#8217;s OK for non-desktop images). For example, for an Ubuntu desktop image, the instance requires about 1.2GB of memory to start up and obviously more to run other programs. Therefore, if we do not specify more RAM, then the VM would struggle to make do of the mere 1GiB of RAM.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"booting-the-ubuntu-desktop-image-on-incus\">Booting the Ubuntu desktop image on Incus</h3>\n\n\n<p>Here is the command to launch a desktop image. We use <code>incus launch</code> to launch the image. It&#8217;s a VM, hence <code>--vm</code>. We are using the image from the <code>images:</code> remote, the one called <code>ubuntu/plucky/desktop</code> (it&#8217;s the last from the list of the previous section). We <mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)\" class=\"has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color\">c</mark>onfigure a new limit for the memory usage, <code>-c limits.memory=3GiB</code>, so that the instance will be able to run successfully. Finally, the console is not textual but graphical. We specify that with <code>--console=vga</code> which means that Incus will launch the remote desktop utility for us. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ <mark style=\"background-color:#7bdcb5\" class=\"has-inline-color\">incus launch --vm images:ubuntu/plucky/desktop mydesktop -c limits.memory=3GiB --console=vga</mark>\nLaunching mydesktop\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of the new window with the running desktop virtual machine. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a

How do I get it back up?</h4>\n\n\n<p>If you closed the Remote Viewer window, you can get Incus to start it again with the following command. By doing so, you are actually reconnecting back to the VM and continue working from where you left off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are using the <code>incus console</code> action to connect to the running <em>mydesktop</em> instance and request access through the Remote Viewer (rather than a text console).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ <mark style=\"background-color:#7bdcb5\" class=\"has-inline-color\">incus console mydesktop --type=vga</mark>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"error-this-console-is-already-connected-force-is-required-to-take-it-over\">Error: This console is already connected. Force is required to take it over.</h4>\n\n\n<p>You are already connected to the desktop VM with the Remote Viewer and you are trying to connect again. Either go to the existing Remote Viewer window, or add the parameter <code>--force</code> to close the existing Remote Viewer window and open a new one. </p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"error-instance-is-not-running\">Error: Instance is not running</h4>\n\n\n<p>You are trying to connect to a desktop VM with the Remote Viewer but the instance (which already exists) is not running. Use the action <code>incus start</code> to start the virtual machine, along with the <code>--type=vga</code> parameter to get Incus to launch the Remote Viewer for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ <mark style=\"background-color:#7bdcb5\" class=\"has-inline-color\">incus start mydesktop --console=vga</mark></code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-get-no-audio-from-the-desktop-vm-how-do-i-get-sound-in-the-desktop-vm\">I get no audio from the desktop VM! How do I get sound in the desktop VM?</h4>\n\n\n<p>This requires extra steps which I do not show yet. There are three options. The first is to use the QEMU device emulation to emulate a sound device in the VM. The second is to somehow push an audio device into the VM so that this audio device is used exclusively in the VM (have not tried this but I think it&#8217;s possible). The third and perhaps best option is to use network audio with PulseAudio/Pipewire. You enable network audio on your desktop and then configure the VM instance to connect to that network audio server. I have tried that and it worked well for me. The downside is that the Firefox snap package in the VM could not figure out that there is network audio there and I could not get audio in that application. </p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-i-shutdown-the-desktop-vm\">How do I shutdown the desktop VM?</h4>\n\n\n<p>Use the desktop UI to perform the shutdown. The VM will shut down cleanly.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"error-failed-instance-creation-the-image-used-by-this-instance-is-incompatible-with-secureboot-please-set-securitysecurebootfalse-on-the-instance\">Error: Failed instance creation: The image used by this instance is incompatible with secureboot. Please set security.secureboot=false on the instance</h4>\n\n\n<p>You tried to launch a virtual machine with SecureBoot enabled but the image does not support SecureBoot. You need to disable SecureBoot when you launch this image. The instance has been created but is unable to run unless you disable SecureBoot. You can either disable SecureBoot through an Incus configuration for this image, or just delete the instance, and try again with the parameter <code>-c security.secureboot=false</code>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how to disable SecureBoot, then try to <code>incus start</code> that instance. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>$ <mark style=\"background-color:#7bdcb5\" class=\"has-inline-color\">incus config set mydesktop security.secureboot=true</mark></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you would enable that flag when you launch such a VM.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>incus launch --vm images:archlinux/desktop-gnome mydesktop -c limits.memory=3GiB --console=vga <mark style=\"background-color:#fcb900\" class=\"has-inline-color\">-c security.secureboot=false</mark></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that official Ubuntu images can work with SecureBoot enabled, most others don&#8217;t. It has to do with the Linux kernel being digitally signed by some certification authority.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"error-failed-instance-creation-failed-creating-instance-record-add-instance-info-to-the-database-failed-to-create-instances-entry-unique-constraint-failed-instancesprojectid-instancesname\">Error: Failed instance creation: Failed creating instance record: Add instance info to the database: Failed to create &#8220;instances&#8221; entry: UNIQUE constraint failed: instances.project_id, instances.name</h4>\n\n\n<p>This error message is a bit cryptic. It just means that you are trying to create or launch an instance while the instance already exists. Read as <em><strong>Error: The instance name already exists</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"saboxplugin-wrap\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemscope itemprop=\"author\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-tab\"><div class=\"saboxplugin-gravatar\"><img alt='Simos Xenitellis' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fadb0e15964fa5c57144f8b9bccf3985281d04e3817a69d0885c0b911d66c59d?s=100&#038;d=wavatar&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fadb0e15964fa5c57144f8b9bccf3985281d04e3817a69d0885c0b911d66c59d?s=200&#038;d=wavatar&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-100 photo' height='100' width='100' itemprop=\"image\"/></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-authorname\"><a href=\"https://blog.simos.info/author/simos/\" class=\"vcard author\" rel=\"author\"><span class=\"fn\">Simos Xenitellis</span></a></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-desc\"><div itemprop=\"description\"></div></div><div class=\"saboxplugin-web \"><a href=\"https://blog.simos.info/\" target=\"_self\" >blog.simos.info/</a></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div></div></div>",

The previous system as Gen 3 annoyed me so much because the laptop randomly woke up from suspend even inside a backpack on its own, heated up the confined air in it, and drained the battery pretty fast as a consequence. Basically it&rsquo;s too sensitive to any events. For example, whenever a USB Type-C cable is plugged in as a power source or whenever something touches the TrackPoint <strong>even if a display on a closed lid slightly makes contact with the red cap, the system wakes up from suspend</strong>. It was uncontrollable.</p>\n<p>I was hoping that Gen 5 would make a difference, and it did when it comes to the power source event. However, frequent wakeups due to the TrackPoint event remained the same so I started to dig in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disabling-touchpad-as-a-wakeup-source-on-t14-gen-5-amd\">Disabling touchpad as a wakeup source on T14 Gen 5 AMD</h2>\n<p>Disabling touchpad events as a wakeup source is straightforward.

Sometimes the boot process gets delayed up to two minutes, because the system still waits for one or more network interfaces to be ready. Systemd provides the <a href=\"https://systemd.io/NETWORK_ONLINE/\"><strong>network-online.target</strong></a> that other service units can rely on, if they are deemed to require network connectivity. But what does “online” actually mean in this context, is a link-local IP address enough, do we need a routable gateway and how about DNS name resolution?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The requirements for an “online” network interface depend very much on the services using an interface. For some services it might be good enough to reach their local network segment (e.g. to announce Zeroconf services), while others need to reach domain names (e.g. to mount a NFS share) or reach the global internet to run a web server. On the other hand, the implementation of <strong>network-online.target</strong> varies, depending on which networking daemon is in use, e.g. <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online.service</strong> or <strong>NetworkManager-wait-online.service</strong>. For Ubuntu, we created a <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/spec-definition-of-an-online-system/27838\">specification</a> that describes what we as a distro expect an “online” system to be. Having a definition in place, we are able to tackle the <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-importance&amp;field.status%3Alist=NEW&amp;field.status%3Alist=OPINION&amp;field.status%3Alist=INVALID&amp;field.status%3Alist=WONTFIX&amp;field.status%3Alist=EXPIRED&amp;field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&amp;field.status%3Alist=TRIAGED&amp;field.status%3Alist=INPROGRESS&amp;field.status%3Alist=FIXCOMMITTED&amp;field.status%3Alist=FIXRELEASED&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;assignee_option=any&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.bug_reporter=&amp;field.bug_commenter=&amp;field.subscriber=&amp;field.structural_subscriber=&amp;field.component-empty-marker=1&amp;field.tag=network-online-ordering&amp;field.tags_combinator=ANY&amp;field.status_upstream-empty-marker=1&amp;field.has_cve.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes.used=&amp;field.omit_dupes=on&amp;field.affects_me.used=&amp;field.has_no_package.used=&amp;field.has_patch.used=&amp;field.has_branches.used=&amp;field.has_branches=on&amp;field.has_no_branches.used=&amp;field.has_no_branches=on&amp;field.has_blueprints.used=&amp;field.has_blueprints=on&amp;field.has_no_blueprints.used=&amp;field.has_no_blueprints=on&amp;search=Search\">network-online-ordering</a> issues that got reported over the years and can work out solutions to avoid <a href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/netplan/+bug/2060311\">delayed boot</a> times on Ubuntu systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, we want systems to reach the following networking state to be considered online:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Do not wait for “optional” interfaces to receive network configuration</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have IPv6 and/or IPv4 “link-local” addresses on every network interface</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have at least one interface with a globally routable connection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have functional domain name resolution on any routable interface</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A common implementation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NetworkManager</strong> and <strong>systemd-networkd</strong> are two very common networking daemons used on modern Linux systems. But they originate from different contexts and therefore show different behaviours in certain scenarios, such as <strong>wait-online</strong>. Luckily, on Ubuntu we already have <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/blog/a-declarative-approach-to-linux-networking-with-netplan\"><strong>Netplan</strong></a> as a unification layer on top of those networking daemons, that allows for common network configuration, and can also be used to tweak the <strong>wait-online</strong> logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the recent release of <a href=\"https://blog.slyon.de/2024/08/14/netplan-v1-1-released/\">Netplan v1.1</a> we introduced initial functionality to tweak the behaviour of the <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online.service</strong>, as used on Ubuntu Server systems. When <strong>Netplan</strong> is used to drive the <strong>systemd-networkd</strong> backend, it will emit an override configuration file in <strong>/run/systemd/system/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service.d/10-netplan.conf</strong>, listing the specific <a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/netplan/pull/456\">non-optional interfaces that should receive link-local IP configuration</a>. In parallel to that, it defines a list of network interfaces that Netplan detected to be potential global connections, and waits for any of those <a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/netplan/pull/482\">interfaces to reach a globally routable state</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such override config file might look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>[Unit]<br>ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=/run/systemd/generator/network-online.target.wants/systemd-networkd-wait-online.service<br><br>[Service]<br>ExecStart=<br>ExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online -i eth99.43:carrier -i lo:carrier -i eth99.42:carrier -i eth99.44:degraded -i bond0:degraded<br>ExecStart=/lib/systemd/systemd-networkd-wait-online --any -o routable -i eth99.43 -i eth99.45 -i bond0</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the new features implemented in Netplan, we reached out to upstream systemd, proposing an <a href=\"https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/34640\">enhancement to the <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong> service</a>, integrating it with <strong>systemd-resolved</strong> to check for the availability of DNS name resolution. Once this is implemented upstream, we’re able to fully control the <strong>systemd-networkd</strong> backend on Ubuntu Server systems, to behave consistently and according to the definition of an “online” system that was lined out above.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Future work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The story doesn’t end there, because Ubuntu Desktop systems are using <strong>NetworkManager</strong> as their networking backend. This daemon provides its very own <strong>nm-online</strong> utility, utilized by the <strong>NetworkManager-wait-online</strong> systemd service. It implements a much higher-level approach, looking at the networking daemon in general instead of the individual network interfaces. By default, it considers a system to be online once every “autoconnect” profile got activated (or failed to activate), meaning that either a IPv4 or IPv6 address got assigned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are considerable enhancements to be implemented to this tool, for it to be controllable in a fine-granular way similar to <strong>systemd-networkd-wait-online</strong>, so that it can be instructed to wait for specific networking states on selected interfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note of caution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Making a service depend on <strong>network-online.target</strong> is considered an antipattern in most cases. This is because networking on Linux systems is very dynamic and the systemd target can only ever reflect the networking state at a single point in time. It cannot guarantee this state to be remained over the uptime of your system and has the potentially to delay the boot process considerably. Cables can be unplugged, wireless connectivity can drop, or remote routers can go down at any time, affecting the connectivity state of your local system. Therefore, “instead of wondering what to do about network.target, please just fix your program to be friendly to dynamically changing network configuration.” [<a href=\"https://systemd.io/NETWORK_ONLINE/#should-network-onlinetarget-be-used\">source</a>].</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>The <a href=\"https://specifications.freedesktop.org/\">Freedesktop.org Specifications</a> directory contains a list of common specifications that have accumulated over the decades and define how common desktop environment functionality works. The specifications are designed to increase interoperability between desktops. Common specifications make the life of both desktop-environment developers and especially application developers (who will almost always want to maximize the amount of Linux DEs their app can run on and behave as expected, to increase their apps target audience) a lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, building the HTML specifications and maintaining the directory of available specs has become a bit of a difficult chore, as the pipeline for building the site has become fairly old and unmaintained (parts of it still depended on Python 2). In order to make my life of maintaining this part of Freedesktop easier, I aimed to carefully modernize the website. I do have bigger plans to maybe eventually restructure the site to make it easier to navigate and not just a plain alphabetical list of specifications, and to integrate it with the Wiki, but in the interest of backwards compatibility and to get anything done in time (rather than taking on a mega-project that can&#8217;t be finished), I decided to just do the minimum modernization first to get a viable website, and do the rest later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, long story short: Most Freedesktop specs are written in <a href=\"https://docbook.org/\">DocBook</a> XML. Some were plain HTML documents, some were DocBook SGML, a few were plaintext files. To make things easier to maintain, almost every specification is written in DocBook now. This also simplifies the review process and we may be able to switch to something else like <a href=\"https://asciidoc.org/\">AsciiDoc</a> later if we want to. Of course, one could have switched to something else than DocBook, but that would have been a much bigger chore with a lot more broken links, and I did not want this to become an even bigger project than it already was and keep its scope somewhat narrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DocBook is a markup language for documentation which has been around for a very long time, and therefore has older tooling around it. But fortunately our friends at openSUSE created <a href=\"https://opensuse.github.io/daps/\">DAPS</a> (DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite) as a modern way to render DocBook documents to HTML and other file formats. DAPS is now used to generate all Freedesktop specifications on our website. The website index and the specification revisions are also now defined in structured TOML files, to make them easier to read and to extend. A bunch of specifications that had been missing from the original website are also added to the index and rendered on the website now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally, I wanted to put the website live in a temporary location and solicit feedback, especially since some links have changed and not everything may have redirects. However, due to how GitLab Pages worked (and due to me not knowing GitLab CI well enough&#8230;) the changes went live before their MR was actually merged. Rather than reverting the change, I decided to keep it (as the old website did not build properly anymore) and to see if anything breaks. So far, no dead links or bad side effects have been observed, but:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you notice any broken link to <a href=\"https://specifications.freedesktop.org/\">specifications.fd.o</a> or anything else weird, please file a bug so that we can fix it!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, and I hope you enjoy reading the specifications in better rendering and more coherent look! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f603.png\" alt=\"😃\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>",

It addresses the challenges of manually hardening servers, which can be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially when managing a large number of servers. The framework integrates with popular infrastructure automation tools like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. It provides pre-configured modules that automatically apply secure settings to your operating systems and services such as OpenSSH, Apache and MySQL. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and reduces the risk of errors.</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">Prepare by LinuxMalaysia with the help of Google Gemini</span></p><br /><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">5 July 2024</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">In Google Doc Format&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;\"><span face=\"Arial,sans-serif\" style=\"background-color: transparent; color: black; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTSU27PLnDXWKjRJfIcjwh9B0jlSN-tnaO4_eZ_0V5C2oYOPLLblnj3jQOzCKqCwbnqGmpTIE10ZiQo/pub\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTSU27PLnDXWKjRJfIcjwh9B0jlSN-tnaO4_eZ_0V5C2oYOPLLblnj3jQOzCKqCwbnqGmpTIE10ZiQo/pub</a>&nbsp;</span></p><br /><br />",

It was definitely more powerful than the predecessor system, but it was clear that QNAP&#8217;s OS was not up to the same standard as Synology&#8217;s &#8211; perhaps best exemplified by &#8220;HappyGet 2&#8221;, the QNAP webapp for downloading videos from streaming services like YouTube, whose icon is a straight rip-off of StarCraft 2. On its own, meaningless &#8211; but a bad omen for overall software quality</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-1325\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"884\" height=\"172\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2.png\" alt=\"The logo for QNAP HappyGet 2 and Blizzard's Starcraft 2 side by side\" class=\"wp-image-1328\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2.png 884w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2-550x107.png 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-2-768x149.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The logo for QNAP HappyGet 2 and Blizzard&#8217;s StarCraft 2 side by side</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the embedded Celeron processor in the NAS turned out to be an issue for some cases. It turns out, when playing back videos with subtitles, most Plex clients do not support subtitles properly &#8211; instead they rely on the Plex server doing JIT transcoding to bake the subtitles directly into the video stream. I discovered this with some Blu-Ray rips of Game of Thrones &#8211; some episodes would play back fine on my smart TV, but episodes with subtitled Dothraki speech would play at only 2 or 3 frames per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final straw was a ransomware attack, which went through all my data and locked every file below a 60MiB threshold. Practically all my music gone. A substantial collection of downloaded files, all gone. Some of these files had been carried around since my college days &#8211; digital rarities, or at least digital detritus I felt a real sense of loss at having to replace. This episode was caused by a ransomware targeting specific vulnerabilities in the QNAP OS, not an error on my part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I decided to start planning a replacement with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A non-garbage OS, whilst still being a NAS-appliance type offering (not an off-the-shelf Linux server distro)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full remote management capabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A small form factor comparable to off-the-shelf NAS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A powerful modern CPU capable of transcoding high resolution video</li>\n\n\n\n<li>All flash storage, no spinning rust</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, no consumer NAS offered everything (The Asustor FS6712X exists now, but didn&#8217;t when this project started), so I opted to go for a full DIY rather than an appliance &#8211; not the first time I&#8217;ve jumped between appliances and DIY for home storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Selecting the core of the system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There aren&#8217;t many companies which will sell you a small motherboard with IPMI. Supermicro is a bust, so is Tyan. But ASRock Rack, the server division of third-tier motherboard vendor ASRock, delivers. Most of their boards aren&#8217;t actually compliant Mini-ITX size, they&#8217;re a proprietary &#8220;Deep Mini-ITX&#8221; with the regular screw holes, but 40mm of extra length (and a commensurately small list of compatible cases). But, thankfully, they do have a tiny selection of boards without the extra size, and I stumbled onto the <a href=\"https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=X570D4I-2T\">X570D4I-2T</a>, a board with an AMD AM4 socket and the mature X570 chipset. This board can use <em>any</em> AMD Ryzen chip (before the latest-gen Ryzen 7000 series); has built in dual 10 gigabit ethernet; IPMI; four (laptop-sized) RAM slots with full ECC support; one M.2 slot for NVMe SSD storage; a PCIe 16x slot (generally for graphics cards, but we live in a world of possibilities); and up to 8 SATA drives OR a couple more NVMe SSDs. It&#8217;s astonishingly well featured, just a shame it costs about $450 compared to a good consumer-grade Mini ITX AM4 board costing less than half that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was so impressed with the offering, in fact, that I crowed about it on Mastodon and ended up securing ASRock another sale, with someone else looking into a very similar project to mine around the same timespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question was the CPU. An important feature of a system expected to run 24/7 is low power, and AM4 chips can consume as much as 130W under load, out of the box. At the other end, some models can require as little as 35W under load &#8211; the OEM-only &#8220;GE&#8221; suffix chips, which are readily found for import on eBay. In their &#8220;PRO&#8221; variant, they also support ECC (all non-G Ryzen chips support ECC, but only Pro G chips do). The top of the range 8 core Ryzen 7 PRO 5750GE is prohibitively expensive, but the slightly weaker 6 core <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-5-pro-5650ge\">Ryzen 5 PRO 5650GE</a> was affordable, and one arrived quickly from Hong Kong. Supplemented with a couple of cheap 16 GiB SODIMM sticks of DDR4 PC-3200 direct from Micron for under $50 a piece, that left only cooling as an unsolved problem to get a bootable test system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official support list for the X570D4I-2T only includes two rackmount coolers, both expensive and hard to source. The reason for such a small list is the non standard cooling layout of the board &#8211; instead of an AM4 hole pattern with the standard plastic AM4 retaining clips, it has an Intel 115x hole pattern with a non-standard backplate (Intel 115x boards have no backplate, the stock Intel 115x cooler attaches to the holes with push pins). As such every single cooler compatibility list excludes this motherboard. However, the backplate is only secured with a mild glue &#8211; with minimal pressure and a plastic prying tool it can be removed, giving compatibility with any 115x cooler (which is basically any CPU cooler for more than a decade). I picked an oversized low profile <a href=\"http://thermalright.com/product/axp120-x67-black-argb/\">Thermalright AXP120-X67</a> hoping that its 120mm fan would cool the nearby MOSFETs and X570 chipset too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1333\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-550x413.jpg 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-768x576.jpg 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_7819-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Thermalright AXP120-X67, AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 5650GE, ASRock Rack X570D4I-2T, all assembled and running on a flat surface</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Testing up to this point</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a spare ATX power supply, I had enough of a system built to explore the IPMI and UEFI instances, and run MemTest86 to validate my progress. The memory test ran without a hitch and confirmed the ECC was working, although it also showed that the memory was only running at 2933 MT/s instead of the rated 3200 MT/s (a limit imposed by the motherboard, as higher speeds are considered overclocking). The IPMI interface isn&#8217;t the best I&#8217;ve ever used by a long shot, but it&#8217;s minimum viable and allowed me to configure the basics and boot from media entirely via a Web browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"905\" height=\"819\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1341\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5.png 905w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5-550x498.png 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-5-768x695.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Memtest86 showing test progress, taken from IPMI remote control window</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One sad discovery, however, which I&#8217;ve never seen documented before, on PCIe bifurcation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With PCI Express, you have a number of &#8220;lanes&#8221; which are allocated in groups by the motherboard and CPU manufacturer. For Ryzen prior to Ryzen 7000, that&#8217;s 16 lanes in one slot for the graphics card; 4 lanes in one M.2 connector for an SSD; then 4 lanes connecting the CPU to the chipset, which can offer whatever it likes for peripherals or extra lanes (bottlenecked by that shared 4x link to the CPU, if it comes down to it).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible, with motherboard and CPU support, to split PCIe groups up &#8211; for example an 8x slot could be split into two 4x slots (eg allowing two NVMe drives in an adapter card &#8211; NVME drives these days all use 4x). However with a &#8220;Cezanne&#8221; Ryzen with integrated graphics, the 16x graphics card slot cannot be split into four 4x slots (ie used for for NVMe drives) &#8211; the most bifurcation it allows is 8x4x4x, which is useless in a NAS.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"897\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1336\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4.png 897w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-550x494.png 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-4-768x690.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 897px) 100vw, 897px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot of PCIe 16x slot bifurcation options in UEFI settings, taken from IPMI remote control window</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, I had to abandon any ideas of an all-NVMe NAS I was considering: the 16x slot split into four 4x, combined with two 4x connectors fed by the X570 chipset, to a total of 6 NVMe drives. 7.6TB U.2 enterprise disks are remarkably affordable (cheaper than consumer SATA 8TB drives), but alas, I was locked out by my 5650GE. Thankfully I found out before spending hundreds on a U.2 hot swap bay. The NVMe setup would be nearly 10x as fast as SATA SSDs, but at least the SATA SSD route would still outperform any spinning rust choice on the market (including the fastest 10K RPM SAS drives)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Containing the core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step was to pick a case and power supply. A lot of NAS cases require an SFX (rather than ATX) size supply, so I ordered a modular <a href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/power-supplies/SX500-G/\">SX500</a> unit from Silverstone. Even if I ended up with a case requiring ATX, it&#8217;s easy to turn an SFX power supply into ATX, and the worst result is you have less space taken up in your case, hardly the worst problem to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, on to picking a case. There&#8217;s only one brand with any cachet making ITX NAS cases, Silverstone. They have three choices in an appropriate size: <a href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/CS01-HS/\">CS01-HS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/CS280/\">CS280</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/DS380/\">DS380</a>. The problem is, these cases are all badly designed garbage. Take the CS280 as an example, the case with the most space for a CPU cooler. Here&#8217;s how close together the hotswap bay (right) and power supply (left) are:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"568\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1343\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6.png 800w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6-550x391.png 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-6-768x545.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Internal image of Silverstone CS280 NAS build.

And it&#8217;s garbage! Total hot garbage! I decided therefore to completely skip the NAS case market, and instead purchase a 5.25&#8243;-to-2.5&#8243; hot swap bay adapter from Icy Dock, and put it in an ITX gamer case with a 5.25&#8243; bay. This is no longer a served market &#8211; 5.25&#8243; bays are extinct since nobody uses CD/DVD drives anymore. The ones on the market are really new old stock from 2014-2017: The <a href=\"https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/core/core-500/black/\">Fractal Design Core 500</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mini-itx/elite130/\">Cooler Master Elite 130</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/SUGO14/\">Silverstone SUGO 14</a>. Of the three, the Fractal is the best rated so I opted to get that one &#8211; however it seems the global supply of &#8220;new old stock&#8221; fully dried up in the two weeks between me making a decision and placing an order &#8211; leaving only the Silverstone case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Icy Dock have a selection of 8-bay 2.5&#8243; SATA 5.25&#8243; hot swap chassis choices in their ToughArmor MB998 series. I opted for the <a href=\"https://global.icydock.com/product_169.html\">ToughArmor MB998IP-B</a>, to reduce cable clutter &#8211; it requires only two SFF-8611-to-SF-8643 cables from the motherboard to serve all eight bays, which should make airflow less of a mess. The X570D4I-2T doesn&#8217;t have any SATA ports on board, instead it has two SFF-8611 OCuLink ports, each supporting 4 PCI Express lanes OR 4 SATA connectors via a breakout cable. I had hoped to get the ToughArmor MB118VP-B and run six U.2 drives, but as I said, the PCIe bifurcation issue with Ryzen &#8220;G&#8221; chips meant I wouldn&#8217;t be able to run all six bays successfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1348\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-550x413.jpg 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-768x576.jpg 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7941-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">NAS build in Silverstone SUGO 14, mid build, panels removed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1349\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-413x550.jpg 413w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7942-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Silverstone SUGO 14 from the front, with hot swap bay installed</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Actual storage for the storage server</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My concept for the system always involved a fast boot/cache drive in the motherboard&#8217;s M.2 slot, non-redundant (just backups of the config if the worst were to happen) and separate storage drives somewhere between 3.8 and 8 TB each (somewhere from $200-$350). As a boot drive, I selected the <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/211868/intel-optane-ssd-p1600x-series-58gb-m-2-80mm-pcie-3-0-x4-3d-xpoint/specifications.html\">Intel Optane SSD P1600X 58G</a>, available for under $35 and rated for 228 years between failures (or 11,000 complete drive rewrite cycles).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, on to the big expensive choice: storage drives. I narrowed it down to two contenders: new-old-stock Intel D3-S4510 3.84TB enterprise drives, at about $200, or Samsung 870 QVO 8TB consumer drives, at about $375. I did spend a long time agonizing over the specification differences, the ZFS usage reports, the expected lifetime endurance figures, but in reality, it came down to price &#8211; $1600 of expensive drives vs $3200 of even more expensive drives. That&#8217;s 27TB of usable capacity in RAID-Z1, or 23TB in RAID-Z2. For comparison, I&#8217;m using about 5TB of the old NAS, so that&#8217;s a LOT of overhead for expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1355\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-550x413.jpg 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-768x576.jpg 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7945-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Storage SSD loaded into hot swap sled</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Booting up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing it all together is the OS. I wanted an &#8220;appliance&#8221; NAS OS rather than self-administering a Linux distribution, and after looking into the surrounding ecosystems, decided on <a href=\"https://www.truenas.com/truenas-scale/\">TrueNAS Scale</a> (the beta of the 2023 release, based on Debian 12).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1024x600.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1353\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1024x600.png 1024w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-550x322.png 550w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-768x450.png 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-1536x900.png 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png 2013w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">TrueNAS Dashboard screenshot in browser window</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I set up RAID-Z1, and with zero tuning (other than enabling auto-TRIM), got the following performance numbers:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>IOPS</td><td>Bandwidth</td></tr><tr><td>4k random writes</td><td>19.3k</td><td>75.6 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>4k random reads</td><td>36.1k</td><td>141 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential writes</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>2300 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential reads</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>3800 MiB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Results using fio parameters <a href=\"https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/evs_faq/evs_faq_0019.html#evs_faq_0019__section273349017162\">suggested by Huawei</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And for comparison, the maximum theoretical numbers quoted by Intel for a single drive:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>IOPS</td><td>Bandwidth</td></tr><tr><td>4k random writes</td><td>16k</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>4k random reads</td><td>90k</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential writes</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>280 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential reads</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>560 MiB/s</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Numbers quoted by Intel SSD successors <a href=\"https://www.solidigm.com/products/data-center/d3/s4510.html\">Solidigm</a>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the numbers reported on the old NAS with four 7200 RPM hard disks in RAID 10:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>IOPS</td><td>Bandwidth</td></tr><tr><td>4k random writes</td><td>430</td><td>1.7 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>4k random reads</td><td>8006</td><td>32 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential writes</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>311 MiB/s</td></tr><tr><td>Sequential reads</td><td>&#8211;</td><td>566 MiB/s</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance seems pretty OK. There&#8217;s always going to be an overhead to RAID. I&#8217;ll settle for the 45x improvement on random writes vs. its predecessor, and 4.5x improvement on random reads. The sequential write numbers are gonna be impacted by the size of the ZFS cache (50% of RAM, so 16 GiB), but the rest should be a reasonable indication of true performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me a little while to fully understand the TrueNAS permissions model, but I finally got Plex configured to access data from the same place as my SMB shares, which have anonymous read-only access or authenticated write access for myself and my wife, working fine via both Linux and Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&#8230; that&#8217;s it! I built a NAS. I intend to add some fans and more RAM, but that&#8217;s the build. Total spent: about $3000, which sounds like an unreasonable amount, but it&#8217;s actually less than a comparable Synology DiskStation DS1823xs+ which has 4 cores instead of 6, first-generation AMD Zen instead of Zen 3, 8 GiB RAM instead of 32 GiB, no hardware-accelerated video transcoding, etc. And it would have been a whole lot less fun!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1364\" srcset=\"https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-413x550.jpg 413w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://apebox.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/img_7958-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The final system, powered up</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>(Also posted on <a href=\"https://pcpartpicker.com/b/fYhtt6\">PCPartPicker</a>)</p>",

Keep reading to better understand why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h2>\n<p>While debugging a package in Ubuntu, one of the first steps you need\nto take is to install its source code.  There are some problems with\nthis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>apt-get source</code> required <code>dpkg-dev</code> to be installed, which ends up\npulling in a lot of other dependencies.</li>\n<li>GDB needs to be taught how to find the source code for the package\nbeing debugged.  This can usually be done by using the <code>dir</code>\ncommand, but finding the proper path to be is usually not trivial,\nand you find yourself having to use more &ldquo;complex&rdquo; commands like\n<code>set substitute-path</code>, for example.</li>\n<li>You have to make sure that the version of the source package is the\nsame as the version of the binary package(s) you want to debug.</li>\n<li>If you want to debug the libraries that the package links against,\nyou will face the same problems described above for each library.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So yeah, not a trivial/pleasant task after all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-solution-dot-dot-dot\">The solution&hellip;</h2>\n<p>Debuginfod can index source code as well as debug symbols.  It is\nsmart enough to keep a relationship between the source package and the\ncorresponding binary&rsquo;s Build-ID, which is what GDB will use when\nmaking a request for a specific source file.  This means that, just\nlike what happens for debug symbol files, the user does not need to\nkeep track of the source package version.</p>\n<p>While indexing source code, debuginfod will also maintain a record of\nthe relative pathname of each source file.  No more fiddling with\npaths inside the debugger to get things working properly.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, if there&rsquo;s a need for a library source file and\nif it&rsquo;s indexed by debuginfod, then it will get downloaded\nautomatically as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dot-dot-dot-but-not-a-perfect-one\">&hellip; but not a perfect one</h2>\n<p>In order to make debuginfod happy when indexing source files, I had to\npatch <code>dpkg</code> and make it always use <code>-fdebug-prefix-map</code> when\ncompiling stuff.  This GCC option is used to remap pathnames inside\nthe DWARF, which is needed because in Debian/Ubuntu we build our\npackages inside chroots and the build directories end up containing a\nbunch of random cruft (like <code>/build/ayusd-ASDSEA/something/here</code>).  So\nwe need to make sure the path prefix (the <code>/build/ayusd-ASDSEA</code> part)\nis uniform across all packages, and that&rsquo;s where <code>-fdebug-prefix-map</code>\nhelps.</p>\n<p>This means that the package <strong>must</strong> honour <code>dpkg-buildflags</code> during its\nbuild process, otherwise the magic flag won&rsquo;t be passed and your DWARF\nwill end up with bogus paths.  This should not be a big problem,\nbecause most of our packages do honour <code>dpkg-buildflags</code>, and those\nwho don&rsquo;t should be fixed anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dot-dot-dot-especially-if-you-re-using-lto\">&hellip; especially if you&rsquo;re using LTO</h2>\n<p>Ubuntu enables <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/LTO-Overview.html\">LTO</a> by default, and unfortunately we are affected by an\n<a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=109805\">annoying (and complex) bug</a> that results in those bogus pathnames not\nbeing properly remapped.  The bug doesn&rsquo;t affect all packages, but if\nyou see GDB having trouble finding a source file whose full path\nstarts without <code>/usr/src/...</code>, that is a good indication that you&rsquo;re\nbeing affected by this bug.  Hopefully we should see some progress in\nthe following weeks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"your-feedback-is-important-to-us\">Your feedback is important to us</h2>\n<p>If you have any comments, or if you found something strange that looks\nlike a bug in the service, please reach out.

I know my limits -- I'm fit enough to easily walk 10-15 miles a day, with a pack, for multiple days in a row.&nbsp; But I also know that I need to be very comfortable in my shoes, and with my pack, and with the right gear.&nbsp; So I spent about 3 weeks walking around my hometown of Austin, Texas, with my pack, \"training\".&nbsp; I walked about 5-7 miles in my (pretty hilly) neighborhood, almost every day, and did one 10 miler around Lady Bird Lake trail in downtown Austin.&nbsp; I wouldn't call this \"training\" per se, but I do think it was pretty valuable acclimation to the mileage and additional weight of a backpack.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><div><br /></div><div>All in all, I felt very well prepared throughout the actual hike on the Camino.</div><div><br /></div><div>More importantly, I was generally pleased with the light weight and balance of my pack.&nbsp; With hindsight, are there a few things I would pack differently?&nbsp; You bet.&nbsp; Here's a spreadsheet I used when packing:</div><div><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvNPCVEyxCfnaQbrDPXbkV0RX2XuARmIpMYK3GsAGcVlL6aU_bQHqcKJsRLQWaKaAftGs-YYbDPALyCbefKrfpVwWDKBayy68oSryFZaAqngqMRb4Fsw_odyCT4PHjunI90NFrXQgjCL2n6GYCe61qOnoYxjXN7BkhwuFslBUeuJa8wW4P231cdvPn/s801/Screenshot%20from%202023-04-24%2008-23-33.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

font-style: italic;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.</div></span></blockquote><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Backpack</h3><div>I decided to upgrade my vintage, 20+ year old Gregory Reality backpack, to a brand new, ultralight <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41nexJD\">Osprey Exos 38L</a>, and that was a great investment!&nbsp; I kept my fully loaded pack to about 18 lbs with an empty water bladder, or 20 lbs with a fully loaded 2L water bladder.&nbsp; That weight was perfect for me.&nbsp; I hardly noticed it at all.&nbsp; I mean, I couldn't \"run\", but at no point in the 160 miles did I ever even think about the backpack's weight or comfort.&nbsp; It was just part of me.&nbsp; I also brought the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mZ5yPV\">over-pack rain shell</a>, which was useful and necessary a couple of times.&nbsp; For what it's worth, my hiking partner used an <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41PnjzX\">Osprey Stratos 36L</a> and he loved his, too.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

It was awesome.&nbsp; I swear by it.&nbsp; It was really nice to sip water along the way, any time, without stopping.</div></div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Shoes</h3><div dir=\"auto\">In my early Camino prep, I also originally figured I'd take my beloved heavy duty leather <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3mUlZgi\">Hanwag hiking boots</a>.&nbsp; However, doing a little bit of research and reading, it seems that all of the distance through hikers these days have moved to using trail running shoes, of which <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oyEOGk\">Hoka Speedgoat</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41UtAdL\">Altra Lone Peak</a> seem to be by far the most popular.&nbsp; I tried both, and really liked the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3L3Bhay\">Altras</a> better.&nbsp; (I got a pretty good deal by buying last year's model).&nbsp; I treated them with a couple of applications of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3n1tr9l\">Scotch Guard</a> for a little bit of extra water resistance.</div><div dir=\"auto\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

There were plenty of people on the Camino wearing both Hoka and Altra, as well as some Soloman's, a few Brooks, and others.&nbsp; I was quite happy with the Altras, all things said.&nbsp; I ended up with a few blisters on the 18 mile days, but I think that was more a matter of my socks.</div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Socks</h3><div dir=\"auto\">Speaking of socks, I only brought&nbsp;my favorite <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3V2u5Qz\">Bombas ankle socks</a>, which are my all-day, everyday socks at home.&nbsp; (I'm a huge fan of Bombas, and generally buy direct from <a href=\"http://Bombas.com\">Bombas.com</a>, as they <a href=\"https://shop.bombas.com/pages/giving-back\">donate socks for every direct purchase</a>).&nbsp; But in retrospect, I probably should have brought purpose made <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3oAMZly\">hiking socks</a> instead.</div><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Alternate Pair of Shoes</h3><div dir=\"auto\">Without a doubt, you'll also need a second pair of shoes for the afternoon / evening, after you're done hiking.&nbsp; I brought my <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41ukvsf\">Olukai flip flops</a> (which I can easily walk/hike 6+ miles in, no question).&nbsp; I liked flip flops because they were light, and could get wet (I used them in the occasional communal / prison-style showers).&nbsp; My hiking partner used lightweight deck shoes as his 2nd pair and he was happy with that as well.&nbsp; The key point is just that you'll absolutely need something to switch into, after a long day of hiking and you really need something that doesn't require socks.</div><div dir=\"auto\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

We did laundry every 4-5 days.&nbsp; Basically I'd wash 4 sets of clothes, while wearing my last set.&nbsp; Most accommodation has some form of laundry facilities.&nbsp; We chose to use the ones that had both washers and dryers (to get everything done in 90 minutes or so), but most people just hang dry their clothes overnight.&nbsp;

Just a bit of chill in the air in the morning (mid 40s-50s Fahrenheit), and warm (high 70s Fahrenheit) most afternoons.&nbsp; As such, I was able to wear long sleeves shirts every day (avoiding some sunscreen on the arms).&nbsp; My go-to shirt for hiking are these <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43TpjsM\">Fjallraven Abisko wool shirts</a>, and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41QJ828\">Fjallraven sun hoodie</a> version.&nbsp; Light, breathable, extraordinarily comfortable.&nbsp;

While it's nice to walk with two poles, one is enough, when packing light.&nbsp; After about day three, I was missing a walking stick, and I picked up a wooden one (as did my hiking partner), but it was awkward and hurt my wrist.&nbsp; So I bought one for 15 euros at the first place I saw one for sale.&nbsp; It was nice enough -- collapsible and spring loaded, but certainly not the highest end equipment.&nbsp; It does say \"Camino de Santiago\" on it, so it's a nice souvenir, and it really helped with the up and down hills on the hike.&nbsp; I had no trouble whatsoever bringing it home on the plane in my carry on backpack, so looking back, I'm sure I could have brought it on very easily.</div><div><br /></div></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 18.72px; font-weight: 700;\">Regarding Accommodations on the Camino</span></div><div><span style=\"font-size: 18.72px; font-weight: 700;\"><br /></span></div><div>There's no camping really (maybe just one or two spots), along the Camino, and lodging is readily available,&nbsp;so there's no need for a tent.&nbsp; If you're flexible (quality and cost, in both directions, up and down), you'll never have a problem finding a place to sleep.&nbsp; At the lowest end, there are plenty of first-come, first-serve, free (or nearly free, with a nominal \"donation\" of 10 euros or so), public \"Albergues\".&nbsp; These are basically hostels, with 30 or more bunk beds in a room, and communal bathrooms and showers.&nbsp; It's meager accommodations, usually in an old monastery or similar historic building.&nbsp; This is the very \"traditional\" Camino experience.</div><div><br /></div><div>Similarly, there are also \"private\" Albergues, which are very similar bunk beds and bath setups, but they do usually take reservations, and are a little newer (maybe cleaner?), and they are also quite affordable (12-20 euros per bed).&nbsp; We poked our head into 3 or 4 public Albergues, and they were all serviceable, but we chose to stay in a couple of private Albergues, mainly because we could make our reservations a few hours or a day or two ahead of time, and have the peace of mind that we were \"booked\".&nbsp; Some private Albergues also have \"private rooms\", which are a really good deal, if you're traveling in a small group of 2-4.</div><div><br /></div><div>I was traveling with one other friend, and 9 of the 12 nights, we managed to book our own private room (usually two twin beds, and an en suite shower and toilet) for about 40 euros for the two of us -- which we always opted for, over say a 12 euro apiece bunk bed.&nbsp; There are a few private apartments and hotels available too -- these are probably in the 50 euro - 80 euro per night range -- still very affordable.&nbsp; For the region we were in, <a href=\"http://Booking.com\">Booking.com</a> (which has a pretty decent app), was absolutely the way to go.&nbsp; It was easy to find availability, prices, features, addresses, ratings, and communicate with the hosts (with translation capabilities built into the messaging app).</div><div><br /></div><div>The only thing we pre-booked before we left home, was our first night at the Hilton in Porto, and our last nights, at the Marriott in Santiago.&nbsp; These were obviously much, much higher end accommodations, and we paid much more for those (nearly 200 euro a night).&nbsp; The fancy digs were nice, but totally unnecessary.</div><div><br /></div><div>Oh, and maybe two nights along the way, we stayed at \"farmhouses\".&nbsp; These were my favorite accommodations by far.&nbsp; One was at a vineyard, with the traditional home cooked, communal dinner, which we shared with 8 other pilgrims.&nbsp; Truly unforgettable experiences.&nbsp; If I were to do the Camino again, I would absolutely seek these out, though you do have to book these in advance (we just got lucky), as they are extremely limited and very popular.</div><div><br /></div><div>Related to accommodations, I also brought my own lightweight <a href=\"https://amzn.to/43XHv4A\">Marmot 55F summer sleeping bag</a>,&nbsp;and a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41SrNpk\">very tiny&nbsp;Summit Aeros Down Inflatable Pillow</a>.&nbsp; This is a tough one.&nbsp; Strictly speaking, these were not entirely necessary.&nbsp; The sleeping bag was a lot of extra weight (1.5 lbs), and every single place we stayed provided sheets, pillows, and pillow cases.&nbsp; I chose to use my own sleeping bag in the 3 bunk room setups, but I totally could have used the provided sheets.&nbsp; All that said, having my own sleeping bag and pillow was an important piece of mind, in that I knew that I could sleep literally anywhere, as long as I had them.&nbsp; On a subsequent Camino, though, I don't think I'd bring a sleeping bag at all, and instead would just plan on taking accommodations that provide sheets, or bring a very&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3N9EBUf\">light sleep sack</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Of course you can order anything you want on the full menu any time.&nbsp; The wine across Galicia and Portugal is amazing!&nbsp; The red wines are mostly Tempranillo (or similar) and the whites are Albarino (or similar) from the Douro valley, and delicious.&nbsp;

For no good reason, I took it out of my pack at the very last minute, and I very much regretted it, almost every single day.</div><div><br /></div><div>Excellent coffee (espressos, cortados, cafe con leche, etc.) is always available at every cafe along the way, and it's really cheap (1 euro typically).&nbsp; But at the hostels and hotels, the coffee is universally awful.&nbsp; There's always a kettle that can boil hot water, and there's usually tea.&nbsp; But almost everywhere has that dissolvable Nescafe instant coffee.&nbsp; I found it just undrinkable.</div><div><br /></div><div>We found a drip coffee maker in just 1 of 12 of our lodgings, and a pod coffee maker (like a Keurig) in just 1 of 12 as well (and that was a private apartment / airbnb type thing).&nbsp; So most mornings meant stumbling out of bed, packing your backpack, maybe choking down some Nescafe, and then bolting down the trail sans caffeine&nbsp;until the first cafe (which was sometimes packed with pilgrims doing the same thing).&nbsp; The Aeropress would have taken very little space, very little weight, and coffee grounds were easily available at markets and kettles for hot water.&nbsp; Seems like such a trivial thing, and maybe I'm more coffee-focused than most, but this was probably my only significant packing regret.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Now, several hundred thousand pilgrims make the trip every year.</li><li>Of the dozens of routes, the most popular is the \"<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://caminoways.com/camino-frances&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1681653706208000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2HrYm4BwD2xV8mBfVlYJgl\" href=\"https://caminoways.com/camino-frances\" style=\"color: #1155cc;\" target=\"_blank\">French Way</a>\", which is the Camino depicted in the movie <i>The Way</i>.&nbsp; It's 422 miles, and takes about 5 weeks.</li><li>Perhaps the second most popular routes is the Portuguese&nbsp;Way, roughly 160 miles and takes about 2 weeks, which is the path we took.</li></ul><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Way</h3><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>We started in Porto, Portugal, and took the \"Central Route\", which is inland among the hills and vineyards, but there's also the \"Coastal Route\", which of course hugs the coast (though the weather can be pretty rough, or so we heard).</li><li>Our Camino Portuguese Central was about 160 miles, and we did it in 12 days of walking, averaging about 13 miles (a half marathon) a day, with our longest days around 18 miles and our shortest about 9 miles.</li><li>There was some elevation to climb and descend every day, but it was all very reasonable.&nbsp; I found it about the same difficulty as hiking around the Texas hill country near Austin.&nbsp; Hilly, but certainly not mountainous.&nbsp; Nothing like Colorado or Switzerland.&nbsp; But also, it's not all just flat walking.</li><li>Most days, we walked for about 3-5 hours,&nbsp;typically starting between 7am and 9am, and finishing around Noon-2pm.</li><li>There were other pilgrims who left much earlier than us every day (probably either much slower, or going much farther, or both), and some who left later, or walked later.</li><li>When we really pushed, with no stops, our fastest miles were about 17 minutes per mile (as measured by my Pixel watch and my hiking partner's Garmin), though a much more comfortable pace, taking a few pictures, conversing, and relaxing a bit, was closer to ~20 minutes a mile.</li><li>Perhaps the most surprising, and maybe most disappointing part about the Camino, is how much of it is on asphalt, concrete, pavement, or cobblestones, and how very little of it is on dirt or rock trails.</li><li>There are probably some official numbers somewhere, but I'd estimate that less than 10-15% of our whole Camino was spent on trails, and 85-90% was spent walking on paved streets or cobble stones.</li><li>Also, I'd say that at least 65-70% was \"urban\", walking among buildings, towns, villages, and only about 30-35% in fields or the woods or within vineyards or farms.</li><li>That might be fine by you, but I think I was expecting something a little more remote.&nbsp; My favorite trails all time are a little more remote treks through Scotland, New Zealand, Switzerland, along the Appalations or the Pacific Northwest -- the Camino is most certainly NOT that.</li><li>But what the Camino is, is a walk through history.&nbsp; Many of those cobblestones I'm complaining about were laid by the Romans (and probably their slaves) literally 2000 years ago.</li><li>Most of the Portuguese Camino follows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_roads\">Roman Road XIX</a> (yes, the Romans basically had a numbered interstate system throughout Europe).</li><li>There are stone mile markers (literally, \"milestones\"), carved in Latin, dating to the 1st century A.D.</li><li>We crossed probably 20 stone arch bridges built by the Romans over 1500 years ago, and another 20 stone bridges built (or re-built) in medieval times 1000 years ago.</li><li>There's just so, so, so much history.&nbsp; Castles, keeps, cathedrals, chapels, aqueducts, olive trees, grape groves -- many over 1000 years old.&nbsp; Let that sink in, and the hard asphalt and pavement do melt away.</li></ul><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Other Pilgrims on the Trail</h3></div><div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>Our first few days, the crowds were very light.&nbsp; We just 1 other pilgrim on the first day, and less than a dozen per day, for the next 3-4 days.</li><li>But as of April 1st, things picked up tremendously.</li><li>Part of it, as we just got closer to Santiago, the trail got busier (back to the point that you must complete the last 100 km on foot to receive the Compostela).</li><li>The other consideration was that we kind of accidentally started our hike that would put us into Santiago for Easter weekend.&nbsp; While that was an accident on our part, thousands of pilgrims traveling for more pious reasons were very deliberately covering the Camino over the course of Holy Week, and planning to land in Santiago specifically for Easter.</li><li>We only met perhaps 5 or 6 other Americans on the trail (a group of 60-something retirees from Rhode Island, and a small group of retired ladies from California).</li><li>From most-to-fewer, we met many Portuguese, Spaniards, Brazilians, Germans, and a smattering of French, Brits, Canadians, Taiwanese, Australians, Danes, Czechs, Swiss, and others I'm sure I'm missing.</li><li>Interestingly, almost no one ever asks your name -- just where you're from.&nbsp; And from then on, you're mostly referred to by your country (or in our case, states, Texas and Colorado).&nbsp; It's kind of a nice convention.</li><li>You end up seeing many of the same people every couple of days, roughly traveling in your cohort from stage to stage.&nbsp; That's pretty fun.&nbsp; Easy to engage, and get into a conversation with anyone, but also easy to keep your privacy and distance.</li><li>The vast majority of people we met on the Camino, have done it before, many of them multiple times (like 7 or 8 times or so), and often different routes each time.</li></ul><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Logistics Advice for the End of the Trail</h3><div style=\"text-align: left;\">We struggled to find much information about how we were supposed to \"complete\" our Camino.&nbsp; <i>Where do we go first?&nbsp; The Cathedral?&nbsp; The Pilgrims' Office?&nbsp; Our hotel?&nbsp; Where is the 0-km marker?</i>&nbsp; Thus, we made a few mistakes, and so we'll try to help you out here...</div></div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Here's what NOT to do....which is exactly what we did....</h4><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>We got in line to visit the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Compostela_Cathedral\">Santiago de Compostela Cathedral</a> itself.</li><li>We waited about 45 minutes, to enter the cathedral and visit the tomb of St. James and get our passport stamped at the cathedral, which seemed like the sensible thing to do, for pilgrims on the Camino.</li><li>HOWEVER, the Cathedral does NOT allow backpacks inside.&nbsp; Thus, we waited 45 minutes to be refused entry because of our backpacks.</li><li>So each of us took turns going inside (by ourselves, without a pack), while the other waited with the backpacks.</li><li>Unbelievably, there is NO passport stamp at the Cathedral itself!&nbsp; Shocking, but true.&nbsp; We asked all over.</li><li>The famous front doors are ONLY open during jubilee years (of which 2023 is not).&nbsp; So instead you enter through the side doors.</li><li>If you want to see the front doors (which are roped off), you'll need to buy a ticket and a tour (which we did a day later).</li><li>The tomb of St. James is under the altar, and there's another 10-15 minute queue inside of the Cathedral to see that.</li></ul></div><div><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Here's what TO DO...</h4><div>Rather, here's a much better plan...&nbsp; Go straight to the Pilgrim's Office, get your Compostela, then check-in to your hotel or accommodations, drop your pack, clean up, and visit the Cathedral afterwards.</div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>The traditional end of the Camino is an old, worn stone tile, with the scallop shell, right in the geometric center of the plaza in front of the cathedral.</li></ul><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

This will probably be one of our longest days, as it just took a while to get out of the city and suburbs of Porto.&nbsp; The walk was nice, but very urban.&nbsp; Mostly hard, cobblestone streets, lots of lots of vehicle traffic, so not ideal trail conditions.&nbsp; We stopped at the 10 mile mark for beers and sandwiches, then kept moving.&nbsp; We peeked in one aubergue (public hostel for pilgrims) and one other private one, before finding a good match here in Vilarinho.&nbsp; It's not very crowded at all on the trail yet. We've only met 4 other pilgrims on the trail so far -- a young lady from Taiwan, an older couple from France (on their 15th Camino) and a guy from Brazil.&nbsp; We seem to be very early in the season.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

It finally feels like we are out of the city and into the countryside.&nbsp; About half of today was about 2/3 pavement, 1/3 trails.&nbsp; We met about 10 other pellegrino's today -- a Brazilian, a Portuguese, 2 Czech, 2 Swiss, 2 Danes, and 2 Canadians.&nbsp; We crossed three different stone bridges built about 1000 years ago (possibly incorporating structures from the Roman era 2000 years ago).&nbsp; Barcelos is our destination for the night, a classic medieval village and home for weary pilgrims for a millennium.&nbsp; Like them, we kicked off our shoes and enjoyed cold beers, delicious wine, and good food.&nbsp; Bom cominho!</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhUFnRJ7J6cd75Xllzv04U5f-XDHqFaEakmS53GToKtpUAuI1iQqnDw5diKnm10ybBcMZkNV6wshDoZ9jkfQA9jaotX2PByl3XUty7ro8YfEdnLsM-f8wbaF2cJzXoGB3LP-BKYQI4I0_EdKQA6YwM-jx-qr08QwrCLmgirIYM-5SAJdGqYyIShS85Y/s1288/02.01.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

Best day on the Camino so far, by far!&nbsp; Much shorter day, we walked a little over 13 miles, mostly on dirt trails through farms and groves and vineyards.&nbsp; We saw a few more pellegrino's today, perhaps a dozen, including a few of the same from the day before.&nbsp; We've covered a few different miles with two different mother/daughter pairs, one Canadian and the other Danish.&nbsp; All of us are more or less in the same cohort, on roughly the same schedule.&nbsp; Our first choice of lodging was totally booked and so we walked an extra couple of miles to our second choice and grabbed the last room.&nbsp; As it turned out, it was an awesome result, as we spent this evening at a hostel within a vineyard, drinking all the wine we could from this vineyard, and eating a communal meal with the other pilgrims here.&nbsp; We shared a table with our Canadian friends, as well as some Brazilians, Germans, and Portuguese.&nbsp; Wonderful day, even better night.</p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1jw7TgeTYRnRXT4pG-ThbwK5yPECCIoE3F58EocqEfhVog6n8EihJCQGnt3XKV8nbWT6TccFz-Zh_82FIM-3EVvYwrmgOg1HwAiRzFvrUiRoqwF17PIgjRb0Qx9Y5qxoT9x7r-HySzqjxfnx7FUjzad03LbPCLo-ot1un303cdESHvHm84Jxrbwkr/s1920/03.01.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

Absolutely wonderful day.&nbsp; Seems like we're finally done with walking along high traffic motor highways and onto trails through fields, farms, vineyards, and orchards.&nbsp; We crossed several stone bridges built by the Romans, reinforced and then widened in the middle ages.&nbsp; These bridges are 1000 to 2000 years old.&nbsp; Spectacular.&nbsp; Nice, easy day, cool, fair weather, good breeze, cloudy and not too much sun.&nbsp; The cork oak trees are beautiful, and some of these olive trees have been growing since Roman times.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Best day of walking so far!&nbsp; A little over 12 miles but the most elevation gain we should see over the entire hike, all in all really not that intense though.&nbsp; We were on beautiful trails and dirt roads for the vast majority of the day.&nbsp; The pellegrino traffic has picked up considerably, now seeing a few dozen pilgrims per day, plus mountain bikers.&nbsp; We've very quickly gone from walking up to our hotels and just getting a room at the end of a long day, to having to have a reservation a day or two in advance.&nbsp; We met our first Americans all week -- a trio of retirees from Rhode Island.&nbsp; There were some amazing waterfalls and mountain streams, and lush, moss and fern covered walls, in addition of course to the vineyards, olive trees, orchards, and cork oaks.&nbsp; The ground was a little moist, but we generally missed the rain again today.&nbsp; A few more Roman era (1st century AD) bridges and roads and water fountains, and a church built in 1295 that is a national monument in Portugal.</div></div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

We got our first taste of slightly damp weather. The forecast was 'rain' but it was more like a very light fog or light drizzle.&nbsp; The last town at the border, Valenca, was a beautiful medieval town with a proper wall and castle and moat.&nbsp;

I played goalie for a couple of kids in a Saturday night futbol match and kept a clean sheet (like 9 saves or so, if I do say so myself)...</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Really hard to believe, but the journey is well over half way over.&nbsp; We gained a full day by walking extra our first 2 days, so we'll probably spend an extra day at the end in Santiago de Compostela.&nbsp; Today's walk from Tui was very, very, VERY different.&nbsp; There were over a hundred at least pellegrino's setting out from Tui for Santiago.&nbsp; The Camino was packed with pilgrims.&nbsp; Very different. It seems that the pellegrino traffic picks up considerably in the last 100km or so. This was also our first day out walking before sunrise, which made for some great pictures. In any case, we had a nice short walk today, along an ancient, 2000 year old Roman road, across a couple of Roman era bridges, into the town of O Porinño, where we had the best meals of our journey.&nbsp; Because our distance was shorter (and the time change moving into Spain) we arrived much earlier, and enjoyed the best meals of our trip so far.&nbsp; We did some laundry, had a nap and a siesta, and then a great evening too.&nbsp; Hard to believe we are wrapping this up so soon.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqRrZWN5NUjWUhShoJI94XHE1pegDyJvojPBVXKr3Ca64qivgm1WHmUoEBYYRjUnMxoUVW4Ac-6uk1iOs6FPx3zji-vpv56cr3P5b7_PRUvfbk6_FRmUOnNr1rOJ4oY5VFHDksPreWSel--OeoWvVUr9l4p6uTMZO83hb1V4Tu3IABP5_uql9XGz3y/s1422/07.01.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

The trail started out somewhat crowded but thinned out a bit mid morning.&nbsp; We climbed about a 1000 foot hill and back down towards the end of today's walk, which afforded some beautiful views of the valley and the water.&nbsp; Our hostel for the night is right next door to a small cheese and meat and meticulously curated bottle shop, where we enjoyed charcuterie plates twice today, plus a delicious Palo Cortado sherry, a tawny port, and a couple of interesting beers.&nbsp;

Still, very fair weather and a really beautiful day.&nbsp; We opt for a couple of slightly longer, slightly more scenic \"complementario\" routes, hoping to avoid some of the crowds.&nbsp; Speaking of...it's crowded now.&nbsp; The Camino is a highway of pilgrims trying to make it into Santiago for Easter.&nbsp; Of course we walked along the ancient Roman XIX road (yes, the Romans numbered their major roads across Europe like Interstate highways in the US), and several Roman era bridges, including a beautiful one in Arcade.&nbsp; We also had a magical experience at a bakery in Arcade recommended by our butcher friend a town or two back.&nbsp; In Pontevedra, we visited an extremely well curated art museum with several Velasquez, Goya, and other Spanish masters.&nbsp; But the antiquities really shine, with a couple of gold and silver hordes from the area, dated to almost 3000 years ago.&nbsp; Lots of history and natural beauty today.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

The Camino for traffic is in full force from here on in.&nbsp; Hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of pellegrino's now cover the trails.&nbsp; Young, old, native, foreign, walking with kids, with dogs, with backpacks and without, and a few annoying groups who think that you want to listen to their Bluetooth speaker for 4 hours.&nbsp; Everyone is on the trail now!&nbsp; Most of today was spent on nice trails or small alleys and away from highways.&nbsp; Caldas de Reis is an interesting little town, surrounding a network of hot springs which have been in continuous use since the time of Ptolemy and the Romans.&nbsp;

Crowds are heavy -- according to the Camino website, about 1500 pellegrino's are arriving per day.&nbsp; We enjoyed some nice time in the forest, along trails and streams, the usual Roman roads and bridges of antiquity, and plenty of sunshine.&nbsp; The food and drink of Galicia are most delightful, from the sweet pastries for breakfast, breads and meats and cheeses for lunch, and the many varieties of fermented beverages.&nbsp; And the locals are just so incredibly friendly.&nbsp; Every proprietor and shop owner and bar tender treats you like you are the single most important person in the world.&nbsp; In fact, we had drinks this evening at Pepe's place in Padron, where every patron gets a giant bear hug and a kiss on the cheek from Pepe, after you sign his book.&nbsp; This is timeless and precious.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh20p1DItrcZWzuA0-TZ8cWYVMCvLRZIZHq_Beib_1AIxDltBbtmS3mm67G8zsPeMQ7aJo89PYSrhUqE0ejByXiMXo26djcRbhxkZZArEGSJQC8lwVfvyPhkIh3rl9aNuheC2vyLi6IcfX9XuBPtwFUFVuy8V1qJD0fgI15qeBuvFERGQX3-vaDYUBY/s1920/11.01.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

We left our albergue well before dawn, knowing that we had a tough day ahead of us, and a lot of pilgrims doing the same walk, expecting to arrive in Santiago on Good Friday in time for Easter.&nbsp; Our earliest start of the whole trip, it was cold and dark when we started, but also quiet and beautiful and less crowded.&nbsp; We saw both a full moon set and a sun rise, and zipped through trails and small towns.&nbsp; We stopped once for a brief breakfast and picked up sandwiches to go, which came in handy 10 miles later.&nbsp; Once the sun came up, it got hot quickly, and the crowds picked up too.&nbsp; The last few miles into the city were less scenic and more urban, but ticked away pretty quickly.&nbsp; Upon arriving, we weren't sure if the protocol, so we went straight to the cathedral where we waited in a line for a half hour and were turned away because backpacks aren't allowed in the church.&nbsp; So we each took turns, watching one another's packs outside, and doing a quick tour of the church.&nbsp; Then we went to the pilgrim's office a few blocks away and learned that we didn't even have to visit the cathedral to claim our certificate, the Compostela, but we did anyway, so..bonus points?&nbsp; We paid a few euros to get our Latin inscribed parchment (pretty cool actually), and then checked into the hotel, and cleaned up.&nbsp; Then we headed back to the cathedral to actually attend the \"pilgrim's mass\", which happens every day, and they read the names of all the pilgrim's that arrived that day.&nbsp; Except when we got there, we were told that \"every day\" doesn't include \"today\" because today's Good Friday, and there's no mass. And every day doesn't include tomorrow either.&nbsp; Or Sunday.&nbsp; So come back on Monday, two days after you leave.&nbsp; At this point, the religious part is lost on me, but it was a mind clearing, spiritual journey none the less. Anyway, amazing walk!&nbsp; Spectacular weather.&nbsp; Great company.&nbsp; Delicious food. Good people.&nbsp; I'm tired, but refreshed.&nbsp; Challenging, but rewarding! Exhausted, but energized.&nbsp; Appreciative of this experience, but also ready for home with my girls.&nbsp; I'll have a bit more to say later in retrospect, but for now, \"bom comiño!\"</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Rather, we enjoyed a nice day touring the beautiful town of Santiago de Compostela, starting with the museum at the cathedral, which included 4 levels of history around the construction of the structure, art, and artifacts.&nbsp; After that, I think I had the most unique tour I've ever experienced, period...&nbsp; We took a guided tour (albeit entirely in Spanish), whereby we spent almost 90 climbing and crawling around THE ROOF OF THE CATHEDRAL.&nbsp; Yes, you heard me... There's a tour where you basically climb out of a window and look at the cathedral from every possible angle, on the damn roof!&nbsp; This was simple indescribable and incredible.&nbsp; Maybe a little unnerving and uncomfortable at times, but a heck of a lot of fun and a one of a kind experience, never to be missed.&nbsp; The roof was renovated in 2021 and this experience is only recently available.&nbsp; Tomorrow morning is an early bus ride back to Porto, then I fly back through Amsterdam to my girls, and I'm very much looking forward to being home.&nbsp; I'll post again a bit more about the logistics of the trip for those considering something like this, and maybe something a little more introspective about what I found along the way.&nbsp; The way.</div><div><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

You’ve probably seen this as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">set -e</code>, or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">set -o errexit</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sh -e</code>.</p>\n\n<p>People write lists of shell commands in a file and want the script to exit on the first one that fails rather than barreling on and causing damage.  That seems sane.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve always strived to write “shell programs” rather than “shell scripts”.  The difference being that the program will clean up after itself and give sane error messages.  It won’t just exit when <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">mkdir</code> fails and leave the user to understand some message like:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/tmp/work/bcd’: No such file or directory\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>I’ve always felt that errexit makes “good error handling” in shell more difficult.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/en/man1/bash.1.html\">bash(1)</a> man page has the following text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\n  <p>If  a  compound  command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status.  If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a context where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s an example of how painful it can be, and I took way too long today tracking down what was wrong.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>A Programmer starts off with a simple script <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">make-lvs</code> and uses <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">set -e</code>.</p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-bash=\">#!/bin/bash -ex\nlvm lvcreate --size=1G myvg -n mylv0\nlvm lvcreate --size=1G myvg -n mylv1\n</code></pre>\n\n    <p>This looks fine for a “shell script”.  The <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-x</code> argument even makes shell write to standard error the commands it is running.  At this point everyone is happy.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Later the programmer looks at the script and realizes that he/she needs more flags to lvm lvcreate.  So now the script looks like:</p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-bash=\">#!/bin/bash -ex\nlvm lvcreate --ignoremonitoring --yes --activate=y --setactivationskip=n --size=1G --name=mylv0 mylv0\nlvm lvcreate --ignoremonitoring --yes --activate=y --setactivationskip=n --size=1G --name=mylv1 myvg \n</code></pre>\n\n    <p>I’m happy that the programmer here used long format flags as they are much more self documenting so readers don’t have to (as quickly) open up the <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man8/lvcreate.8.html\">lvm man</a> page.   It is easier to make sense of that than it is to read ‘<code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lvm lvcreate --ignoremonitoring -y -ay -ky -L1G -n mylv</code>’.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>After doing so, they realize that they can make this look a lot nicer, and reduce the copy/paste code with a simple function wrapper.</p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-bash=\">#!/bin/bash -e\nlvcreate() {\n    echo \"Creating lv $2 on vg $1 of size $3\"\n    lvm lvcreate \"--size=$3\" --ignoremonitoring --yes --activate=y \\\n        --setactivationskip=n --name=\"$2\" \"$1\"\n    echo \"Created $1/$2\"\n}\n\nlvcreate myvg mylv0 1G\nlvcreate myvg mylv1 1G\n</code></pre>\n\n    <p>The improvements are great.  The complexity of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lvm lvcreate</code> is abstracted away nicely.  They’ve even dropped the vile <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">set -x</code> in favor of more human friendly messages.</p>\n\n    <p>Output of a failing <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lvm</code> command looks like this:</p>\n\n    <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>$ make-lvs; echo \"exited with $?\"\nCreating lv mylv0 on vg myvg of size 1G\nout of space\nexited with 1\n</code></pre></div>    </div>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>The next improvement is where sanity goes completely out the window.  [<em>I realize you were questioning my sanity long ago due to my pursuit of shell scripting perfection</em>].</p>\n\n    <p>The programmer tries to add reasonable ‘FATAL’ messages that you might find in log messages of other other programming languages.</p>\n\n    <pre><code class=\"language-bash=\"> #!/bin/bash -e\n lvcreate() {\n     echo \"Creating lv $2 on vg $1 of size $3\"\n     lvm lvcreate \"--size=$3\" --ignoremonitoring --yes --activate=y \\\n         --setactivationskip=n --name=\"$2\" \"$1\"\n     echo \"Created $1/$2\"\n }\n fail() { echo \"FATAL:\" \"$@\" 1&gt;&amp;2; exit 1; }\n    \n lvcreate myvg mylv0 1G || fail \"Failed to create mylv0\"\n    \n if ! lvcreate myvg mylv1 2G; then\n     fail \"Failed to create lylv1\"\n fi\n echo \"Success\"\n</code></pre>\n\n    <p>Can you guess what is going to happen here?</p>\n\n    <p>If the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lvm</code> command fails (perhaps the vg is out of space) then the output of this script will look like:</p>\n\n    <div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code> $ make-lvs; echo exited with $?\n Creating lv mylv1 on vg myvg of size 1G\n error: out of space\n Created myvg/mylv1\n Creating lv mylv2 on vg myvg of size 1G\n error: out of space\n Created myvg/mylv2\n Success\n exited with 0\n</code></pre></div>    </div>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The attempt to handle the failure of the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">lvcreate</code> function with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">||</code> on lines 10 and with <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">if !</code> on line 12 made it a “compound command”.  A compound command disables the error handling and shell exit that would have come from <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-e</code> when the lvm command on line 4 failed.</p>\n\n<p>Above I’ve demonstrated with bash, but this is actually posix behavior, and you can just as well test the function with <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/sh.1.html\"><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">sh</code></a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Madness.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re interested in further reading, you can see this topic on the <a href=\"https://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105\">BashFAQ</a>.  I agree with GreyCat and geirha: “don’t use set -e. Add your own error checking instead.”</p>\n\n<p>If you’re <em>still</em> here, the following is the version of the script that I’d like to see. Of course there are other improvements that can be made, but I’m happy with it.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash=\">   #!/bin/bash\n   info() { echo \"$@\" 1&gt;&amp;2; }\n   stderr() { echo \"$@\" 1&gt;&amp;2; }\n   fail() { stderr \"FATAL:\" \"$@\"; exit 1; }\n   lvcreate() {\n       local vg=\"$1\" lv=\"$2\" size=\"$3\"\n       info \"Creating $vg/$lv size $size\"\n       lvm lvcreate \\\n           --ignoremonitoring --yes --activate=y --setactivationskip=n \\\n           --size=\"$size\" --name=\"$lv\" \"$vg\" || {\n               stderr \"failed ($?) to create $vg/$lv size $size\"\n               return 1\n           }\n       info \"Created $vg/$lv\"\n   }\n   \n   # demonstrate both 'command ||' and 'if ! command; then' styles.\n   lvcreate myvg mylv0 1G || fail \"Failed to create mylv0\"\n   \n   if ! lvcreate myvg mylv1 1G; then\n       fail \"Failed to create mylv1\"\n   fi\n   \n   info \"Success\"\n</code></pre>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>At <a href=\"https://kde.org/\">KDE</a> we have multiple levels of quality assurance ranging from various degrees of a humans testing features to fully automated testing. Indeed automated testing is incredibly important for the continued quality of our software. A big corner stone of our testing strategy are so called unit tests, they test a specific piece of our software for its behavior in isolation. But for many aspects of our software we need a much higher level view, testing pieces of Plasma&#8217;s application launcher in isolation is all good and well but that won&#8217;t tell us if the entire UI can be easily navigated using the keyboard. For this type of test we require a different testing approach altogether. A couple months ago I&#8217;ve set <a href=\"https://markmail.org/message/toklo6unkc3bmuww\">set out</a> to create a <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi\">testing framework</a> for this use case and I&#8217;m glad to say that it has matured enough to be used for writing tests. I&#8217;d like to walk you through the technical building blocks and a simple example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us start of by looking at the architecture at large. So&#8230; there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\">Selenium</a> which is an incredibly popular, albeit web-oriented, testing framework. Its main advantages for us are its popularity and that it sports a server-client split. This means we can leverage the existing client tooling available for Selenium without having to write anything ourselves, we only need to grow a server. The server component, called a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/\">WebDriver</a>, implements the actual interaction with UI elements and is generic enough to also apply to desktop applications. Indeed so thought others as well: there already exists <a href=\"https://appium.io\">Appium</a> &#8211; it extends Selenium with more app-specific features and behaviors. Something for us to build upon. The clients meanwhile are completely separate and talk to the WebDriver over a well defined JSON REST protocol, meaning we can reuse the existing clients without having to write anything ourselves. They are available in a multitude of programming languages, and who knows maybe we&#8217;ll eventually get one for writing Selenium tests in QML <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"😉\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That of course doesn&#8217;t explain how GUI testing can work with this on Linux. Enter: <a href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Accessibility/AT-SPI2/\">AT-SPI</a>. AT-SPI is an accessibility API and pretty much the standard accessibility system for use on Linux. Obviously its primary use is assistive technologies, like the screen reader <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca\">Orca</a>, but to do its job it essentially offers a toolkit-independent way of introspecting and interacting with GUI applications. This then gives us a way to implement a WebDriver without caring about the toolkit or app specifics. As long as the app supports AT-SPI, which all Qt apps do implicitly, we can test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all the client tooling is independent of the server all we needed to get GUI testing going was a WebDriver that talks to AT-SPI.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"167\" data-attachment-id=\"1910\" data-permalink=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/2022/12/14/selenium-at-spi-gui-testing/selenium/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png\" data-orig-size=\"2007,329\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"selenium\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=615\" src=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1910\" srcset=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=1024 1024w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=150 150w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=300 300w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=768 768w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png?w=1440 1440w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/selenium.png 2007w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That is what I set out to write and I&#8217;m happy to announce that we now have an <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi\">AT-SPI based WebDriver</a>, and the <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kdeplasma-addons/-/merge_requests/291\">first</a> tests are popping into existence already. There is also lovely <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi/-/wikis/writing-tests\">documentation</a> to hold onto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, without further ado. Let us write a simple test. Since the <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi/-/wikis/writing-tests\">documentation</a> already writes one in Python I&#8217;ll use Ruby this time around so we have some examples of different languages. A simple candidate is KInfoCenter. We can test its search functionality with a couple of lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First we need to install <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi\">selenium-webdriver-at-spi</a>, clone it, cmake build it, and cmake install it. You&#8217;ll also need to install the relevant client libraries. For ruby that&#8217;s simply running <code>gem install appium_lib</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we can start with writing our test. We will need some boilerplate setup logic. This is more or less the same for every test. For more details on the driver setup you may also check the <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi/-/wikis/writing-tests\">wiki page.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: ruby; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\">\n  def setup\n    @appium_driver = Appium::Driver.new(\n      {\n        &#039;caps&#039; =&gt; { app: &#039;org.kde.kinfocenter.desktop&#039; },\n        &#039;appium_lib&#039; =&gt; {\n          server_url: &#039;http://127.0.0.1:4723&#039;,\n          wait_timeout: 10,\n          wait_interval: 0.5\n        }\n      }, true\n    )\n    @driver = @appium_driver.start_driver\n  end\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The driver will take care of starting the correct application and make sure that it is actually running correctly. Next we&#8217;ll write the actual test. Let&#8217;s test the search. The first order of business is using a tool called <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/accerciser\">Accerciser</a> to inspect the AT-SPI presentation of the application. For more information on how to use this tool please refer to the wiki. Using Accerciser I&#8217;ve located the search field and learned that it is called &#8216;Search&#8217;. So, let&#8217;s locate it and activate it, search for the CPU module:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: ruby; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\">\n  def test_search\n    search = driver.find_element(:name, 'Search')\n    search.click\n    search.send_keys('cpu')\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Next let us find the CPU list item and activate it:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: ruby; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\">\n    cpu = driver.find_element(:class_name, '&#91;list item | CPU]')\n    assert(cpu.displayed?)\n    cpu.click\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>And finally let&#8217;s assert that the page was actually activated:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: ruby; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\">\n    cpu_tab = driver.find_element(:class_name, '&#91;page tab | CPU]')\n    assert(cpu_tab.displayed?)\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>To run the complete test we can use the run wrapper: <code>selenium-webdriver-at-spi-run ./kinfocentertest.rb</code> (mind that it needs to be +x). If all has gone well we should get a successful test.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate\">\nFinished in 1.345276s, 0.7433 runs/s, 1.4867 assertions/s.\n\n1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips\nI, &#91;2022-12-14T13:13:53.508516 #154338]  INFO -- : tests done\nI, &#91;2022-12-14T13:13:53.508583 #154338]  INFO -- : run.rb exiting true\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>This should get you started with writing a test for <strong>your</strong> application! I&#8217;ll gladly help and review your forthcoming tests.<br>For more detailed documentation check out the <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi/-/wikis/writing-tests\">writing-tests</a> wiki page as well as the <a href=\"https://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/\">appium command reference</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course the work is not done. <code>selenium-webdriver-at-sp</code>i is very much still a work in progress and I&#8217;d be glad for others to help add features as they become needed. The <a href=\"https://invent.kde.org/sdk/selenium-webdriver-at-spi\">gitlab project</a> is the place for that. <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complete code of the example above:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code \"><pre class=\"brush: ruby; title: ; notranslate\">\n#!/usr/bin/env ruby\n# frozen_string_literal: true\n\n# SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-only OR GPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-KDE-Accepted-GPL\n# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2022 Harald Sitter &lt;sitter@kde.org&gt;\n\nrequire &#039;appium_lib&#039;\nrequire &#039;minitest/autorun&#039;\n\nclass TestKInfoCenter &lt; Minitest::Test\n  attr_reader :driver\n\n  def setup\n    @appium_driver = Appium::Driver.new(\n      {\n        &#039;caps&#039; =&gt; { app: &#039;org.kde.kinfocenter.desktop&#039; },\n        &#039;appium_lib&#039; =&gt; {\n          server_url: &#039;http://127.0.0.1:4723&#039;,\n          wait_timeout: 10,\n          wait_interval: 0.5\n        }\n      }, true\n    )\n    @driver = @appium_driver.start_driver\n  end\n\n  def teardown\n    driver.quit\n  end\n\n  def test_search\n    search = driver.find_element(:name, &#039;Search&#039;)\n    search.click\n    search.send_keys(&#039;cpu&#039;)\n\n    cpu = driver.find_element(:class_name, &#039;&#91;list item | CPU]&#039;)\n    assert(cpu.displayed?)\n    cpu.click\n\n    cpu_tab = driver.find_element(:class_name, &#039;&#91;page tab | CPU]&#039;)\n    assert(cpu_tab.displayed?)\n  end\nend\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"817\" data-attachment-id=\"1904\" data-permalink=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/2022/12/14/selenium-at-spi-gui-testing/kinfocenter-test/#main\" data-orig-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif\" data-orig-size=\"1040,830\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"kinfocenter-test\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=615\" src=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1904\" srcset=\"https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=1024 1024w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=150 150w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=300 300w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif?w=768 768w, https://apachelog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinfocenter-test.gif 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>I first installed Ubuntu when Ubuntu 6.06 LTS &#8220;Dapper Drake&#8221; was released. I was brand new to Linux. This was Ubuntu&#8217;s first LTS release; the very first release of Ubuntu was only a year and a half before. I was impressed by how usable and useful the system was. It soon became my primary home operating system and I wanted to help make it better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On October 15, 2009, I was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2009/10/15/%23edubuntu.html#t16:16\" target=\"_blank\">helping test</a> the release candidates ISOs for the Ubuntu 9.10 release. Specifically, I tested Edubuntu. Edubuntu has since been discontinued but at the time it was an official Ubuntu flavor preloaded with lots of education apps. One of those education apps was <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://moodle.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Moodle</a>, an e-learning platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When testing Moodle, I found that a default installation would make Moodle impossible to use locally. I figured out how to fix this issue. This was really exciting: I finally found an Ubuntu bug I knew how to fix. I filed the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://launchpad.net/bugs/452622\" target=\"_blank\">bug report</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was very late in the Ubuntu 9.10 release process and Ubuntu was in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FinalFreeze\" target=\"_blank\">Final Freeze</a> state. In Final Freeze, every upload to packages included in the default install need to be individually approved by a member of the Ubuntu Release Team. Also, I didn&#8217;t have upload rights to Ubuntu. Jordan Mantha (<em>LaserJock</em>), an Edubuntu maintainer, sponsored my bug fix upload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also forwarded my patch <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/551402\">to Debian</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While trying to figure out what wasn&#8217;t working with Moodle, I stumbled across a packaging bug. Edubuntu provided a choice of MySQL or PostgreSQL for the system default database. MySQL was the default, but if PostgreSQL were chosen instead, Moodle wouldn&#8217;t work. I figured out how to fix <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://launchpad.net/bugs/440098\" target=\"_blank\">this bug</a> too a week later. Jordan sponsored this upload and Steve Langasek from the Release Team approved it so it also was able to be fixed before 9.10 was released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the first bug was new to 9.10 because of a behavior change in a low-level dependency, this PostgreSQL bug existed in stable Ubuntu releases. Therefore, I prepared <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stable Release Updates </a>for Ubuntu 9.04 and Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Afterwards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Six months later, I was able to attend my first Ubuntu Developer Summit. I was living in Bahrain (in the Middle East) at the time and a trip to Belgium seemed easier to me than if I were living in the United States where I usually live. This was the Ubuntu Developer Summit where planning for Ubuntu 10.10 took place. I like to believe that I helped with the naming since I <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames?action=diff&amp;rev1=594&amp;rev2=595\">added</a> <em>Maverick</em> to the wiki page where people contribute suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not apply for financial sponsorship to attend and I stayed in a budget hotel on the other side of Brussels. The <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UDS-M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">event venue</a> was on the outskirts of Brussels so there wasn&#8217;t a direct bus or metro line to get there. I rented a car. I didn&#8217;t yet have a smartphone and I had a LOT of trouble navigating to and from the site every day. I learned then that it&#8217;s best to stay close to the conference site since a lot of the event is actually in the unstructured time in the evenings. Fortunately, I managed to arrive in time for Mark Shuttleworth&#8217;s keynote where the Unity desktop was first announced. This was released in Ubuntu 10.10 in the Ubuntu Netbook Remix and became the default for Ubuntu Desktop in Ubuntu 11.04.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ubuntu&#8217;s switch to Unity provided me with a huge opportunity. In April 2011, GNOME 3.0 was released. I wanted to try it but it wasn&#8217;t yet packaged in Ubuntu or Debian. It was suggested that I could help work on packaging the major new version in a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA\" target=\"_blank\">PPA</a>. The PPA was convenient because I was able to get permission to upload there easier than being able to upload directly to Ubuntu. My contributions there then enabled me to get upload rights to the Ubuntu Desktop packages later that year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a later Ubuntu Developer Summit, it was suggested that I start an official Ubuntu flavor for GNOME. So along with Tim Lunn (<em>darkxst</em>), I co-founded Ubuntu GNOME. Years later, Canonical stopped actively developing Unity; instead, Ubuntu GNOME was merged into Ubuntu Desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, I became an <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#Ubuntu_Core_Developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ubuntu Core Developer</a> and a <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Debian Developer</a>. And in January 2022, I joined Canonical on the Desktop Team. This all still feels amazing to me. It took me a long time to be comfortable calling myself a developer!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first Ubuntu bugfix was 13 years ago this week. Because Ubuntu historically uses alphabetical adjective animal release names, 13 years means that we have rolled around to the letter K again! Later today, we begin release candidate ISO testing for Ubuntu 22.10 &#8220;Kinetic Kudu&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage you to help us test the release candidates and report bugs that you find. If you figure out how to fix a bug, we still <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SponsorshipProcess\">sponsor</a> bug fixes. If you are an Ubuntu contributor, I highly encourage you to attend an Ubuntu Summit if you can. The first Ubuntu Summit in years will be in 3 weeks in Prague, but the intent is for the Ubuntu Summits to be recurring events again.</p>",

We don’t discuss a lot of development or marketing, those are done by separate teams, but just the business-y stuff. We have our meeting using the <a href=\"https://chat.inkscape.org\">Inkscape Rocketchat server</a> and then I download the logs and put them in the PLC Git repo. There it is put in a standard IRC log format (we did the meetings in IRC before we had Rocketchat) and rendered to HTML. You can see <a href=\"https://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/Leadership_Committee_Status_Updates#Meeting_Transcripts\">all the meeting transcripts</a> listed on the Wiki page. While not super special, I’ve done it for a while and I don’t think how I do it has been posted anywhere. This blog post is solely to reduce the bus factor, hopefully no one will need it.</p>\n\n<p>First step is to get the logs as JSON files using <a href=\"https://github.com/willardb/rocketchat-history-downloader\">Rocketchat History Downloader</a>. I’m not doing anything really special there, I’m executing it like: <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">pipenv run python export-history.py settings.cfg</code>. In my settings I’ve configured my login along with pointing it at the Inkscape Rocketchat server. The other settings I’ve left at default. Probably room for optimization, but I’m only running once a month. For me all the history files are then in the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">history-files</code> directory.</p>\n\n<p>The next step is to turn the JSON into something similar to an IRC log. This is more trickey than it sounds and I’ve ended up with a small little shell script based on <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\">jq</a> that I use to turn the JSON into an IRC log:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-sh highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>jq <span class=\"s1\">'.messages[]|(.ts|capture(\"(?&lt;date&gt;.*)\\\\.[0-9]+Z$\").date+\"Z\"|fromdate|strftime(\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\"))+\" &lt;\"+ if .alias then .alias else .u.username end +\"&gt; \"+.msg'</span> | <span class=\"nb\">sed</span> <span class=\"nt\">-e</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"s|^.||\"</span> <span class=\"nt\">-e</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"s|.</span><span class=\"nv\">$|</span><span class=\"s2\">|\"</span> <span class=\"nt\">-e</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"s|</span><span class=\"se\">\\\\\\\\\\\"</span><span class=\"s2\">|</span><span class=\"se\">\\\"</span><span class=\"s2\">|g\"</span> | <span class=\"nb\">sort</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>It does a number of things. It reformats the date to match the IRC format. It handles the alias that is used by the Inkscape IRC bot for IRC users in the chat. It handles all the quoting and quoting of quoting that the JSON/jq pipeline gives it. And it sorts by the timestamp (which the downloader doesn’t and I find weird). I’m not going to go through the whole thing but you should ready the <a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/\">jq documentation</a> if you’re curious about the individual items.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s it folks. Not super hard but I wanted to make sure it was documented somewhere.</p>",

It’s not hard; just stop smoking the bloody things.</p>\n<p>The rest is understanding your body and addiction, that smoking never made you feel better, it only made <em>not smoking</em> feel worse. As soon as you cut that cycle, your body recalibrates. As soon as you realise that, the infinitesimal cost of quitting seems worth it.</p>\n<p>If you’re trying to quit and you’re not finding it easy, stick with it. If you need help understanding addiction, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0615482155\">Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking</a> has an eerily convincing narrative that plods through the feelings every smoker goes through. I never finished it —I convinced myself I didn’t want to quit— but it was absolutely the basis for the voice in my head that let me quit later on.</p>",

For example, if you started with this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:c\">\r\nstruct foo {\r\n    unsigned long flags;\r\n    u32 length;\r\n    u32 data[1];\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid foo_init(int count)\r\n{\r\n    struct foo *instance;\r\n    size_t bytes = sizeof(*instance) + sizeof(u32) * (count - 1);\r\n    ...\r\n    instance = kmalloc(bytes, GFP_KERNEL);\r\n    ...\r\n};\r\n</pre>\n<p>And you changed only the struct definition:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:diff\">\r\n-    u32 data[1];\r\n+    u32 data[];\r\n</pre>\n<p>The <code>bytes</code> calculation is going to be incorrect, since it is still subtracting 1 element&#8217;s worth of space from the desired count. (And let&#8217;s ignore for the moment the open-coded calculation that may end up with an arithmetic over/underflow here; that can be solved separately by using the <code>struct_size()</code> helper or the <code>size_mul()</code>, <code>size_add()</code>, etc family of helpers.)</p>\n<p>The missed adjustment to the size calculation is relatively easy to find in this example, but sometimes it&#8217;s much less obvious how structure sizes might be woven into the code. I&#8217;ve been checking for issues by using the fantastic <a href=\"https://diffoscope.org/\">diffoscope</a> tool. It can produce a LOT of noise if you try to compare builds without keeping in mind the issues solved by <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/kbuild/reproducible-builds.html\">reproducible builds</a>, with some additional notes. I prepare my build with the &#8220;known to disrupt code layout&#8221; options disabled, but with debug info enabled:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ KBF=\"KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP=1980-01-01 KBUILD_BUILD_USER=user KBUILD_BUILD_HOST=host KBUILD_BUILD_VERSION=1\"\r\n$ OUT=gcc\r\n$ make $KBF O=$OUT allmodconfig\r\n$ ./scripts/config --file $OUT/.config \\\r\n        -d GCOV_KERNEL -d KCOV -d GCC_PLUGINS -d IKHEADERS -d KASAN -d UBSAN \\\r\n        -d DEBUG_INFO_NONE -e DEBUG_INFO_DWARF_TOOLCHAIN_DEFAULT\r\n$ make $KBF O=$OUT olddefconfig\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then I build a stock target, saving the output in &#8220;before&#8221;. In this case, I&#8217;m examining <code>drivers/scsi/megaraid/</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ make -jN $KBF O=$OUT drivers/scsi/megaraid/\r\n$ mkdir -p $OUT/before\r\n$ cp $OUT/drivers/scsi/megaraid/*.o $OUT/before/\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then I patch and build a modified target, saving the output in &#8220;after&#8221;:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ vi the/source/code.c\r\n$ make -jN $KBF O=$OUT drivers/scsi/megaraid/\r\n$ mkdir -p $OUT/after\r\n$ cp $OUT/drivers/scsi/megaraid/*.o $OUT/after/\r\n</pre>\n<p>And then run <code>diffoscope</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ diffoscope $OUT/before/ $OUT/after/\r\n</pre>\n<p>If <code>diffoscope</code> output reports nothing, then we&#8217;re done. 🥳</p>\n<p>Usually, though, when source lines move around other stuff will shift too (e.g. <code>WARN</code> macros rely on line numbers, so the bug table may change contents a bit, etc), and <code>diffoscope</code> output will look noisy. To examine just the executable code, the command that <code>diffoscope</code>  used is reported in the output, and we can run it directly, but with possibly shifted line numbers not reported. i.e. running <code>objdump</code> without <code>--line-numbers</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ ARGS=\"--disassemble --demangle --reloc --no-show-raw-insn --section=.text\"\r\n$ for i in $(cd $OUT/before && echo *.o); do\r\n        echo $i\r\n        diff -u <(objdump $ARGS $OUT/before/$i | sed \"0,/^Disassembly/d\") \\\r\n                <(objdump $ARGS $OUT/after/$i  | sed \"0,/^Disassembly/d\")\r\ndone\r\n</pre>\n<p>If I see an unexpected difference, for example:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:diff\">\r\n-    c120:      movq   $0x0,0x800(%rbx)\r\n+    c120:      movq   $0x0,0x7f8(%rbx)\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then I'll search for the pattern with line numbers added to the <code>objdump</code> output:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ vi <(objdump --line-numbers $ARGS $OUT/after/megaraid_sas_fp.o)\r\n</pre>\n<p>I'd search for \"0x0,0x7f8\", find the source file and line number above it, open that source file at that position, and look to see where something was being miscalculated:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:shell\">\r\n$ vi drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_fp.c +329\r\n</pre>\n<p>Once tracked down, I'd start over at the \"patch and build a modified target\" step above, repeating until there were no differences. For example, in the starting example, I'd also need to make this change:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:diff\">\r\n-    size_t bytes = sizeof(*instance) + sizeof(u32) * (count - 1);\r\n+    size_t bytes = sizeof(*instance) + sizeof(u32) * count;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Though, as hinted earlier, better yet would be:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush:diff\">\r\n-    size_t bytes = sizeof(*instance) + sizeof(u32) * (count - 1);\r\n+    size_t bytes = struct_size(instance, data, count);\r\n</pre>\n<p>But sometimes adding the helper usage will add binary output differences since they're performing overflow checking that might saturate at <code>SIZE_MAX</code>. To help with patch clarity, those changes can be done separately from fixing the array declaration.</p>\n<p style='text-align:left'>&copy; 2022 - 2023, <a href=\"https://outflux.net/blog/\">Kees Cook</a>.

I&rsquo;m running the\nlatest Ubuntu LTS on my work laptop.</p>\n<p>The laptop is connected to a <a href=\"https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/\">CalDigit\nTS3-Plus</a> which is my docking station.\nThis was one of the few docking station which supported 4K@60Hz back when I bought\nthis. I would prefer a docking station with more USB-ports. Right now I have another\nUSB-Hub (hidden under the desktop) because the ports provided by most of the\ndocking stations out there are not really enough for me.</p>\n<h1 id=\"audio-and-video\">Audio and Video</h1>\n<p>As already mentioned above, I use my Canon EOS 700D as my webcam. I&rsquo;ll mostly\nuse an 18-55mm lens. The camera is connected to an <a href=\"https://www.elgato.com/en/cam-link-4k\">elgato Cam Link 4k</a>.\nThe biggest downside of this setup currently is that the format is not perfect,\nas the HDMI-output has two black bars on the left and right side of the video.</p>\n<p>I try to keep my background as boring as possible, that&rsquo;s why all of you will\nmostly only see my yellow wall behind me.</p>\n<p>As a microphone, I use an <a href=\"https://m-audio.de/uber-mic\">M-Audio Uber-Mic</a>. It&rsquo;s\nbeing used in meetings and also for my (German) podcast <a href=\"tilpod.net\">TILpod</a>\nwhich I record remotely with <a href=\"https://dirk.deimeke.ruhr/\">Dirk Deimeke</a>. For\nlistening in meetings and also for videos/music, I&rsquo;m using my Sony WH-1000X3.</p>\n<h1 id=\"lighting\">Lighting</h1>\n<p>I do not have a perfect lighting solution yet. I do have a small desk light\nwhich is okay for the desk itself but not for video calls. The main light\nin my office is an <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/floalt-led-lichtpaneel-dimmbar-weissspektrum-20436317/\">IKEA Floalt</a>\nwhich can be dimmed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-else-is-on-the-desk\">What else is on the desk?</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Stream Deck, mostly for changing audio settings</li>\n<li>a mechanical keyboard (HyperX with brown Cherry MX switches)</li>\n<li>a boring Logitech mouse</li>\n<li>a big mouse pad</li>\n<li>a wrist rest pad</li>\n<li>some old Logitech speaker</li>\n<li>a Brother printer/scanner</li>\n<li>a YubiKey 5 NFC</li>\n<li>a few (water) bottles</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"what-do-i-use-for-on-the-go\">What do I use for on the go?</h1>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t really travel that much for obvious reasons.

This post is part of <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://jelmer.uk/tag/janitor-update.html\">a series</a> about the progress of the&nbsp;Janitor.</p>\n<p>As covered in <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.jelmer.uk/fresh-builds.html\">my post from last week</a>, the Janitor now regularly tries to\nimport new upstream git snapshots or upstream releases into packages in <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable\">Sid</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"moving-parts\">\n<h2>Moving&nbsp;parts</h2>\n<p>There are about 30,000 packages in sid, and it usually takes a couple of weeks\nfor the janitor to cycle through all of them. Generally speaking, there are up\nto three moving targets for each&nbsp;package:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>The packaging repository; <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://qa.debian.org/cgi-bin/vcswatch\">vcswatch</a> regularly scans this for changes,\nand notifies the janitor when a repository has changed. For <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://salsa.debian.org\">salsa</a>\nrepositories it is instantly notified through a web&nbsp;hook</li>\n<li>The upstream release tarballs; the <span class=\"caps\">QA</span> watch service regularly polls these,\nand the janitor scans for changes in the <span class=\"caps\">UDD</span> tables with watch data (used for\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://janitor.debian.net/fresh-releases/\">fresh-releases</a>)</li>\n<li>The upstream repository; there is no service in Debian that watches this at\nthe moment (used for\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://janitor.debian.net/fresh-snapshots/\">fresh-snapshots</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the janitor notices that one of these three targets has changed, it\nprioritizes processing of a package - this means that a push to a packaging\nrepository on salsa usually leads to a build being kicked off within 10\nminutes. New upstream releases are usually noticed by <span class=\"caps\">QA</span> watch within a day or\nso and then lead to a build. Now commits in upstream repositories don&#8217;t get\nnoticed&nbsp;today.</p>\n<p>Note that there are no guarantees; the scheduler tries to be clever and not\ne.g. rebuild the same package over and over again if it&#8217;s constantly changing\nand takes a long time to&nbsp;build.</p>\n<p>Packages without priority are processed with a scoring system that takes into\naccount perceived value (based on e.g. popcon), cost (based on wall-time\nduration of previous builds) and likelihood of success (whether recent builds\nwere successful, and how frequently the repositories involved&nbsp;change).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"webhooks-for-upstream-repositories\">\n<h2>webhooks for upstream&nbsp;repositories</h2>\n<p>At the moment there is no service in Debian (yet - perhaps this is something\nthat vcswatch or a sibling service could also do?) that scans upstream\nrepositories for&nbsp;changes.</p>\n<p>However, if you maintain an upstream package, you can use a webhook to notify\nthe janitor that commits have been made to your repository, and it will create\na new package in fresh-snapshots. Webhooks from the\nfollowing hosting site software are currently&nbsp;supported:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://gitlab.com/\">Gitlab</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://launchpad.net/\">Launchpad</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://gitea.io/\">Gitea</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://gogs.io/\">Gogs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can simply use the <span class=\"caps\">URL</span> <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://janitor.debian.net/\">https://janitor.debian.net/</a> as the target for hooks. There is no need to specify a secret, and the hook can either use a <span class=\"caps\">JSON</span> or form encoding&nbsp;payload.</p>\n<p>The endpoint should tell you whether it understood a webhook request, and\nwhether it took any action. It&#8217;s fine to submit webhooks for repositories that\nthe janitor does not (yet) know&nbsp;about.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"github-1\">\n<h3>GitHub</h3>\n<p>For GitHub, you can do so in the <tt class=\"docutils literal\">Webhooks</tt> section of the <tt class=\"docutils literal\">Settings</tt> tab.

    "contentHtml": "<p>Six months ago I was elected to the Ubuntu Community Council. After the first month, I wrote a text about how I <a href=\"https://torstenfranz.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/my-first-month-at-the-ubuntu-community-council/\">experienced the first month</a>. Time flies and now six months have already passed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first few months we have been able to fill some of the councils and boards that needed to be refilled in the community. But even where this has not been possible, we have initiated new ways to ensure that we move forward on the issues. One example is the LoCo Council, which could not be filled again, but we found people who were given the task of rethinking this council and proposing new structures. This process of evaluating and rethinking this area will take some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some issues that we have on the agenda at the moment. Some of these are general issues related to the community, but some affects individual members of the community or where there are problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some topics, we quickly realised that it makes sense to have contact persons at Canonical who can advance these topics. We were very pleased to find Monica Ayhens-Madon and Rhys Davies, two employees at Canonical, who support us in bringing topics into the organisation and also implement tasks. One consequence of this has been the <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/re-introducing-the-community-team/21820\">reactivation of the Community Team at Canonical</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One topic that we have also come across, through the staffing of the board and the update of the benefits that you get as a member, is the Ubuntu Membership. At this point I would like to advertise the community and to show your community connection with Ubuntu through a membership. If you want to do this and know what benefits you are entitled to, you can read about it in the <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership\">Ubuntu Wiki</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are still enough construction sites, but structurally we are already on the right track again. Since the topics are dealt with in our free time and everyone on the Community Council has other things to do, topics sometimes drag on a bit. Sometimes I&#8217;m a bit impatient, but I&#8217;m getting better at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After six months, I can see that we as a Community Council have laid many building blocks and have already had some discussions where we have different approaches and thus also very different ideas. This is good for the community and leads to the different positions and opinions finding their way into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read about our public meetings in the <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/community/78\">Community Hub</a>. There is also the possibility, when we call for topics for our meetings, to bring in topics that we should look at in the Council, because this is important for the cooperation of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get involved in discussions about the community, you can do so at the <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/\">Community Hub</a>. You can also send us an email to the mailing list community-council at lists.ubuntu.com if you have a community topic on your mind. If you want to contact me: you can do so by commenting, via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toddyfranz\">Twitter</a> or sending a mail to me: torsten.franz at ubuntu.com</p>",

Taking your pool and moving it to another machine is sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>This will probably give you the necessary information (alongside with the post on <a href=\"https://didrocks.fr/2020/06/11/zfs-focus-on-ubuntu-20.04-lts-zsys-partition-layout/\">partition</a> and <a href=\"https://didrocks.fr/2020/06/16/zfs-focus-on-ubuntu-20.04-lts-zsys-dataset-layout/\">dataset</a> layouts) if you want to turn your existing ZFS system to one compatible with ZSys.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, it’s time to directly check all that on details!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"zfs-properties\">ZFS properties</h2>\n\n<p>Of course, ZFS datasets properties are the main source of information when we build up a representation of the system when starting ZSys. We are using in particular <code>canmount</code> and <code>mountpoint</code> ZFS properties. While the usage of <code>mountpoint</code> is unequivocal, <code>canmount</code> has 3 meaningful states for us:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>off</strong>: we ignore the dataset (apart when reverting) in those cases. This dataset will not be mounted (but still snapshotted if part of system datasets). This is used by default on &ldquo;container&rdquo; filesystem dataset, like <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_123456/var/lib</code> in the server layout we demonstrated in our previous post which can then host <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_123456/var/lib/apt</code> for instance.</li>\n<li><strong>on</strong>: those are the current (or previous boot at least) datasets that were mounted. We turn every datasets we want to mount and act on to that value in our <code>zsysd boot-prepare</code> call in the generator to prepare the system booting on the correct set of datasets.</li>\n<li><strong>noauto</strong>: we set that value for any clones (previous system or user states) when reverting. This is another task that <code>zsysd boot-prepare</code> is doing (and thus, as you can reckon, we made sure that <code>zsysd boot-prepare</code> is idempotent): turning previous <strong>canmount=on</strong> datasets to <strong>noauto</strong> when reverting and either creating new clones (boot from a saved state made of snapshots) or turning all clones associated to a state your already booted on from <strong>canmount=noauto</strong> to <strong>on</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is what allows preserving clones and switching throughout them, allowing system bisection (reverting the revert!).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"zfs-user-properties-for-zsys\">ZFS user properties for ZSys</h2>\n\n<p>On top of that, we are using a bunch of user properties to achieve our additional functionalities on top of pure ZFS one. All ZSys related properties starts with <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:</code> prefix.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zfs-user-properties-on-system-datasets\">ZFS user properties on system datasets</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s look at those on a filesystem dataset state (current or part of history):</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get com.ubuntu.zsys:last-booted-kernel,com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used,com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\nNAME                      PROPERTY                            VALUE                               SOURCE\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-booted-kernel  vmlinuz-5.4.0-29-generic            local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used           1589438938                          local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs              yes                                 local\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see 3 properties on those root pool:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"last-booted-kernel\">Last Booted Kernel</h4>\n\n<p>This property is storing the last successful kernel with booted with. This is used when building the GRUB menu, in particular on state saves, to ensure the &ldquo;Revert&rdquo; entry boot with the exact same kernel version, even if not last available.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"last-used\">Last used</h4>\n\n<p>This is a timestamp of last successful boot. This is used for filesystem datasets related state to help the garbage collector assessing what to collect (on snapshots dataset, we only take their creation time of course) and printing an accurate time (related to your system timezone) in the GRUB menu.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bootfs\">Bootfs</h4>\n\n<p>This is a marker on the root and any datasets you want to mount in the initramfs. It identifies as well ZSys machines, so that the daemon avoid treating non ZSys installation.</p>\n\n<p>Contrary to upstream ZFS initramfs support (very early in the machine boot), when reverting on a state associated to snapshot datasets, we only clone and mount datasets having <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs</code> property set to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; (local or inherited) if this property is set (we are thus still compatible with manually crafted ZFS installation). The remaining datasets will be cloned on early boot by the <code>zsysd boot-prepare</code> called in the ZFS mount generator.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we do that? Remember complex layout like the server one? As a reminder, we end up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zsysctl show --full\n[…]\nSystem Datasets:\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n […]\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/AccountsService\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/NetworkManager\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/apt\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/dpkg\nUser Datasets:\n[…]\nPersistent Datasets:\n - rpool/var/lib\n […]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reminder: <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib</code> has <strong>canmount=off</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine now that on boot, we clone (for reverting) and mount dataset all children on <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@…</code>. This would mount in the initramfs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>/</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@…</code></li>\n<li><code>/var</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@…</code></li>\n<li><code>/var/lib/AccountsService</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/AccountsService@…</code></li>\n<li><code>/var/lib/NetworkManager</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/NetworkManager@…</code></li>\n<li><code>/var/lib/apt</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/apt@…</code></li>\n<li><code>/var/lib/dpkg</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var/lib/dpkg@…</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then, the machine starts booting and when reaching the ZFS mount generator, or <code>zfs-mount.service</code>, it will try to mount <code>/var/lib</code> (from <code>rpool/var/lib</code>) which will fail as we already have some <code>/var/lib/*</code> subdirectories created and mounted.</p>\n\n<p>The same idea applies when you create any persistent dataset with <strong>canmount=on</strong> (like <code>rpool/var/lib</code>) and when some children (in term of mountpoint hierarchy) of this persistent dataset is a system dataset (like <code>rpool/var/lib/apt</code>).</p>\n\n<p>This is why we set on <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var</code> <strong>bootfs=no</strong> (and in any direct children of <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code>) so that you can create any persistent datasets without any headache. This property avoids hardcoding &ldquo;only mount the root dataset and no child&rdquo; in the code and is more flexible for the advanced user.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var\nNAME                          PROPERTY                VALUE                   SOURCE\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs  no                      local\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"zfs-user-properties-on-system-datasets-for-snapshot-datasets\">ZFS user properties on system datasets for snapshot datasets</h3>\n\n<p>We store slightly more property on snapshots and the syntax is different:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get all rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s\n[…]\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs              yes:local                           local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:canmount            on:                                 local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-booted-kernel  vmlinuz-5.4.0-26-generic:local      local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:mountpoint          /:local                             local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used           1589438938                          inherited from rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In addition to the previous listed user properties, you can see that we are storing <code>canmount</code> and <code>mountpoint</code> as user properties. We store them to save their value of both those properties when we are taking a state save. For instance, if we change the mountpoint property on <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code>, this would have impacted all of its snapshots like <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s</code>. It means that we wouldn’t have a way to know what was the original value when we saved a particular state, which really corresponds to the given state. Similarly, we &ldquo;set in stone&rdquo; the last booted kernel property which would have changed over time otherwise, as inherited from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code> last-booted-kernel value.</p>\n\n<p>You can also see above that we append on the first 4 properties <strong>:local</strong> (local source) or just <strong>:</strong> (default property). This is used to know and recreate the exact source of inheritance chain for any property. Indeed, in ZFS:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s</code> inherits from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code> for all its properties that can be inherited</li>\n<li><code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var</code> inherits from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code>.</li>\n<li>However <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s</code> inherits from … <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var</code> and not from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s</code>!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This inheritance chain of ZFS is logical when you reason dataset per dataset. However, we are creating machines with ZSys and it means that some properties that should logically inherit (if not overridden) from the root snapshots are instead inheriting from the immediate parent in term of ZFS logic.</p>\n\n<p>To recreate a &ldquo;machine&rdquo; state inheritance logic, we append thus the source property value to the value for datasets. If we look at <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get all rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s\n[…]\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:mountpoint          /var:inherited                      local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-booted-kernel  vmlinuz-5.4.0-26-generic:inherited  local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs              no:local                            local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:canmount            off:local                           local\nrpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used           1589438938                          inherited from rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, we can see that <strong>canmount=off</strong> was stored from the value on <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var</code> when the state was saved and it was a local property on this one: <strong>off:local</strong>. Same thing for the <strong>bootfs</strong> property. However, we can see that both the <strong>mountpoint</strong> or the <strong>last-booted-kernel</strong> were inherited properties (not set explicitly) from its parent, <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code> and as such, <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1/var@autozsys_08865s</code> from <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_08865s</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When doing a revert on a state associated to snapshot datasets, we restore any <strong>local</strong> values (suffix <strong>:local</strong>) by resetting the values, and ignore any inherited or default ones, as the normal new clone datasets inheritance will thus restore regular ZFS inheritance scheme. This is how we can recreate high fidelity revert, without being impacted by future changes you have made in ZFS datasets after the state save was taken. This is also one way we track changes in datasets layouts while still reverting to the previous available layout.</p>\n\n<p>You can see that we don’t set any <strong>last-used</strong> properties on snapshot datasets and let them inherited from the parent. It doesn’t even have any <strong>:</strong> suffix! This is a value that we just ignore and use, as previously told, the snapshot creation time for those states made of snapshot datasets (they only apply to states made of filesystem datasets, like clones).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"zfs-user-properties-on-user-datasets\">ZFS user properties on user datasets</h3>\n\n<p>More simple than system datasets, user datasets have a couple of user properties:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get all rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\n[…]\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets  rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1         local\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used        1589438938                       local\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The second one is straightforward: this is the last used time for this dataset to help the garbage collector. Similarly to system states, if the state is made of snapshot datasets, the creation time is used.</p>\n\n<p><code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> is the mechanism which associates this user dataset with the <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code> state.\nThis is how user state made of filesystem datasets can be linked to system states and <code>zsysctl show --full</code> confirms this:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zsysctl show --full\nName:               rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n[…]\nSystem Datasets:\n - bpool/BOOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n[…]\nUser Datasets:\n User: didrocks\n - rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>User state made of snapshots datasets are way easier: they are linked by the snapshot name, this is why this user state is linked to this system state:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zsysctl show --full\nHistory:\n  - Name:               rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_8cjrb0\n    System Datasets:\n     - bpool/BOOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_8cjrb0\n     - rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1@autozsys_8cjrb0\n     […]\n    User Datasets:\n      User: didrocks\n        - rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the previous case, <code>@autozsys_8cjrb0</code> is the link. When we revert to that state and create clone filesystem datasets for a new read-write state, we thus associate the user dataset to that state by tagging the user dataset with <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> matching the state name (this is done in the <code>zsysd boot-prepare</code> call from the ZFS mount generator).</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"shared-user-states\">Shared user states</h4>\n\n<p>What happens though if you revert your system state without reverting the user data? This is where things are becoming interesting: for each users, we take the previous active user state and retag it by appending the newly created system state.</p>\n\n<p>You thus have an user state with multiple values, separated by <strong>,</strong>, like <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets=rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1,rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_fa2wz74</code>. This is the mechanism that allows you to revert the revert, with the exact same user data! The user state is then shared.</p>\n\n<p>However, each user state can be different, for instance you may want to add <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3/tools</code> to only one system state. The annotation allows that by tagging <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets=rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_fa2wz74</code> on this one for instance.</p>\n\n<p>We would thus end up with:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zsysctl show --full\nName:               rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_fa2wz74\n[…]\nUser Datasets:\n User: didrocks\n - rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\n - rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3/tools\n\n[…]\nHistory:\n  - Name:               rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1\n    […]\n    User Datasets:\n      User: didrocks\n        - rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The user state associated to <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_fa2wz74</code> is now named <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3.rpool.ROOT.ubuntu-fa2wz74</code> and his compounded of 2 filesystem datasets: <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3</code> and <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3/tools</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The user state associated to <code>rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1</code> is now named <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3.rpool.ROOT.ubuntu-e2wti1</code> and only has one filesystem dataset: <code>rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Those 2 user states sharing some common user datasets are now logically separated and can be referenced directly, without any confusion, but the user. If you revert or remove a system state, we just untag the system state that needs to be detached: the user state can still be useful for other states and only the needed datasets (like the <code>/tools</code> one) will be deleted.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"zfs-user-properties-on-user-datasets-made-of-snapshot-datasets\">ZFS user properties on user datasets made of snapshot datasets</h4>\n\n<p>We already discussed that the snapshot name is the association between system and user states. Similarly to system state snapshots, we store <code>canmount</code> and <code>mountpoint</code> to freeze those properties in time when saving the state. We append the source after <strong>:</strong> to track parent and children association.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ zfs get all rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0\n[…]\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0  com.ubuntu.zsys:canmount         on:local                         local\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0  com.ubuntu.zsys:mountpoint       /home/didrocks:local             local\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0  com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets  rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_e2wti1         inherited from rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\nrpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3@autozsys_8cjrb0  com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used        1589438938                       inherited from rpool/USERDATA/didrocks_wbdgr3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, we let the normal ZFS inheritance value on <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:bootfs-datasets</code> and <code>com.ubuntu.zsys:last-used</code> but those are ignored when restoring a state as the state association is made via snapshot name match and last used is taken from the snapshot dataset creation time.</p>\n\n<p>You now have a way (until we grow a command for doing this) to manually enroll existing user datasets to a system once you understand this concept!</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h1>\n\n<p>Phew! We hope that now that you have a complete pictures on all those concepts, you can really appreciate what we try to bring as our ubuntu ZFS on root experience and how. ZSys provides a way to manage and monitor the system, while doing automated state saving to offer you reliable revert capability. We are paving the first steps to provide a strong and bullet-proof desktop system to our audience. The main idea is that most of the features are managed automatically for you, and we will provide more and more facilities in the future.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in reading further ahead, you can check our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV5-ef-fqzML4MGd2LAHRcLdR0USKkOmrJW-AP0CmC4/edit\">in progress specification</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/ubuntu/projects/1\">follow our github project</a>. This is a good place, as <a href=\"https://github.com/ubuntu/zsys\">the upstream ZSys repo is</a>, to see how you can contribute to this effort and help shaping the future on ZFS on root on ubuntu! This is in addition to all the enhancements, maintenance and fixes that are heading Ubuntu 20.04 LTS right now.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this read was pleasing to you and that understanding the internals and challenges has highlighted why built this tool, how much thoughts and great care we took in crafting the whole system. Of course, there would be a lot more to say, like how we built our extensive testsuite on ZSys itself with the internal in-memory mock and real ZFS system stack, how we have hundreds of tests on our grub menu generation, how we handled some optimizations over the <a href=\"https://github.com/bicomsystems/go-libzfs\">go-libzfs package</a> and much more! But we have to stop at point and this is the good place for it. We can always continue the conversation via the <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/zfs-focus-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-blog-posts/16355\">dedicated Ubuntu discourse thread</a>.</p>",

That cut us off from a vital communication link with you.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">This proposal process, along with fixing some bugs and creating some commits mean that you have real experience you can take with you into the future</span><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">. I hope you also learned how to use IRC/Matrix/Telegram channels to get information, and help others as well. Even if you do not continue your involvement with the KDE Community, we hope you will profit from these accomplishments, as we have.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">We hope that your experiences with the KDE community up to now make you want to continue to work with us, and become part of the community. Many students whom we were not able to accept previously were successfully accepted later. Some of those students now are mentoring and/or part of the administration team, which is, in our eyes, the zenith of GSoC success.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Some of you we were unable to accept because we could not find suitable mentors. The GSoC team is asking us this year to have <i>three mentors per student</i>, because the world has become so uncertain in this pandemic time. So more developers who will mentor are a precious resource.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Almost every single proposal we got this year is work we want and need, or we wouldn't have published \"Ideas\" to trigger those proposals. If you are interested in doing this work and do not need the funding and deadlines that GSoC provides, we would welcome working with you outside of GSoC. In fact, each year we have <i><b>Season of KDE</b></i> which provides some mentoring, structure and timeline and no funding. This has been very successful for most mentees. And of course all are welcome to join our worldwide army of volunteers, who code, fix bugs, triage bug reports, write, analyze, plan, administer, create graphics, art, promo copy, events, videos, tutorials, documentation, translation, internationalization, and more! It is the KDE community who makes the software, keeps it up-to-date, plans and hosts events, and engages in events planned and hosted by others.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><br /></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Please join the <a href=\"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-community\">KDE-Community mail list</a> and dig in!

And it doesn't help at all that there is trans antagonist crap from the past and also from the present popping up left and right at a pace and a concentrated amount that is hard to swallow on its own without the puberty.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, I used to be able to take those things with a much more stable state. But every. Single. Of. These. Issues is draining all the energy out of myself. And even though I'm aware that I'm not the only one trying to fix all of those, even though for some spots I'm the only one doing the work, it's easier said than done that I don't have to fix the world, when the areas involved mean the world to me. Are areas that support me in so many ways. Are places that I need. And on top of that, the hormones are multiplying the energy drain of those.</p>\n\n<p>So ... I know it's not that common. I know you are not used to a grown up person to go through puberty. But for god's sake. Don't make it harder than it has to be. I know it's hard to deal with a 46 year old teenager, so to say, I'm just trying to survive in this world of systematic oppression of trans people.</p>\n\n<p>It would be nice to go for a week without having to cry your eyes out because another hostile event happened that directly affects your existence. The existence of trans lives aren't a matter of different opinions or different points of view, so don't treat it like that, if you want me to believe that you are a person able of empathy and basic respect.</p>\n\n<p>Sidenote: Finishing to write this at this year's <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2019/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">#36c3</a> is quite interesting because of the conference title: <em>Resource Exhaution</em>.

Easy, I’m doing this in Gitlab CI, and I suppose other CI will encounter similar issues. It’s not possible to connect to the instances using the instructions above.<br />\n\n<h2 id=\"first-step\">\nFirst Step</h2>\nWe get our inventory in a dynamic way.  For this we will use the <a href=\"https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#inventory-script-example-aws-ec2\">inventory</a> scripts.<br />\n\nWe need to modify the ec2.ini file with uncommenting the <code>vpc_destination_variable</code>  and set the value to <code>private_ip_address</code><br />\n\nAn example<br />\n\n<pre><code># For server inside a VPC, using DNS names may not make sense. When an instance\n# has 'subnet_id' set, this variable is used. If the subnet is public, setting\n# this to 'ip_address' will return the public IP address. For instances in a\n# private subnet, this should be set to 'private_ip_address', and Ansible must\n# be run from within EC2. The key of an EC2 tag may optionally be used; however\n# the boto instance variables hold precedence in the event of a collision.\n# WARNING: - instances that are in the private vpc, _without_ public ip address\n# will not be listed in the inventory until You set:\nvpc_destination_variable = private_ip_address\n#vpc_destination_variable = ip_address\n</code></pre>\nBe sure to have your ansible.cfg, with the following line.<br />\n\n<pre><code>host_key_checking = False\n</code></pre>\nThis is useful, as we’re running this in a CI, we can’t hit enter to accept the connection in  the terminal.<br />\n\nThen we begin working with our yml file. As I’m running this on a container, I need to create the <code>.ssh</code> directory and the config file. Here it’s important to add <strong>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</strong> If we don’t do this, this will fail in our CI, as we can’t hit enter. If you don’t included it and run it locally, it will work.<br />\n\n<pre><code>---\n- name: Creates ssh directory\n  file:\n    path: ~/.ssh/\n    state: directory\n\n\n- name: Create ssh config file in local computer\n  copy:\n    dest: ~/.ssh/config\n    content: |\n       Host 10.*.*.*\n       User ubuntu\n       IdentityFile XXXXX.pem\n       StrictHostKeyChecking=no\n       ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p {{ lookup('env', 'IP') }}\n       Host {{ lookup('env', 'IP') }}\n       User ubuntu\n       StrictHostKeyChecking=no\n       IdentityFile XXXXX.pem\n       ForwardAgent yes\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd finally we test it running the ping command.<br />\n\n<pre><code>---\n- name: test connection\n  ping:\n\n</code></pre>\nIn case you need the code : <a href=\"https://github.com/DiegoTc/bastionansible\">https://github.com/DiegoTc/bastionansible</a><br />\n\n</div>\n</body>\n\n</html>",

Many other companies and projects had representatives (including Collabora, Elementary OS, Endless, Igalia, Purism, RedHat, SUSE and System76). I think this was the most positive GUADEC I've attended, with people from all these organizations actively leading discussions and a general consideration of each other as we try and maximise where we can collaborate. <br />\n<br />\nOf course, the community is much bigger than a group of companies. In particular is was great to meet Carlo and Frederik from the <a href=\"https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru\">Yaru</a> theme project. They've been doing amazing work on a new theme for Ubuntu and it will be great to see it land in a future release.<br />\n<br />In the <a href=\"https://www.gnome.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GNOMEAnnualReport-2018-final.pdf\">annual report</a> there was a nice surprise; I made the most merge requests this year! I think this is a reflection on the step change in productivity in GNOME since switching to GitLab.

Two talks I'd like to highlight; the first one is by Britt Yazel from the <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Engagement\">Engagement team</a>. In it he talks about <i>Setting a Positive Voice for GNOME</i>. He talked about how open source communities have a lot of passion - and that has good and bad points. The Internet being as it is can lead to the trolls taking over but we can counter that but highlighting positive messages and showing the people behind GNOME. One of the examples showed how Ubuntu and GNOME have been posting positive messages on their channels about each-other, which is great!<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"YOUTUBE-iframe-video\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S8OoacfLep4/0.jpg\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8OoacfLep4?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<br />\nThe second talk was by Georges Basile Stavracas Neto and he talked <i>About Maintainers and Contributors</i>. In it he talked about the difficulties of being a maintainer and the impacts of negative feedback. It resonated with Britt's talk in that we need to highlight that maintainers are people who are doing their best! As state in the GNOME Code of Conduct - <i>Assume people mean well</i> (they really do!).<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<iframe width=\"320\" height=\"266\" class=\"YOUTUBE-iframe-video\" data-thumbnail-src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HsCp3gFhXko/0.jpg\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HsCp3gFhXko?feature=player_embedded\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<br />\nGeorges and I are co-maintainers of <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/\">Settings</a> and we had a productive GUADEC and managed to go through and review all the open <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/\">merge requests</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThere were a number of discussions around <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/\">Snaps</a> in GNOME. There seemed a lot more interest in Snap technology compared to last GUADEC and it was great to be able to help people better understand them. Work included discussions about portals, better methods of getting the Freedesktop and GNOME stacks snapped, Snap integration in Settings and the GNOME publisher name in the Snap Store.<br />\n<br />\nI hope to be back next year!</div>",

They proposed new licenses, removing\nestablished freedoms and rights in order to be able to assert that level of\ncontrol. The <a href=\"https://opensource.org/osd\">open source definition</a> defines\nthose minimal freedoms and rights that any open source software should\nhave, so the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>,\nas steadfast guardians of that definition, rightfully resisted those attempts.</p>\n<p>Those companies quickly switched to attacking OSI's legitimacy, pitching \"Open\nSource\" more as a broad category than a clear set of freedoms and rights.\nAnd they created new licenses, with deceptive naming (\"community\", \"commons\",\n\"public\"...) in an effort to blur the lines and retain some of\nthe open source definition aura for their now-proprietary software.</p>\n<p>The solution is not in redefining open source, or claiming it's no longer\nrelevant. Open source is not a business model, or a constantly evolving way\nto produce software. It is a base set of user freedoms and rights expressed\nin the license the software is published under. Like all standards, its value\nresides in its permanence.</p>\n<p>Yes, I'm of the opinion that today, \"open source\" is not enough.\nYes, we need to go beyond open source. But in order to do that, we need to\nbase that additional layer on a solid foundation: the\n<a href=\"https://opensource.org/osd\">open source definition</a>.</p>\n<p>That makes the work of the <a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">OSI</a> more important\nthan ever. Open source used to be attacked from the outside, proprietary\nsoftware companies claiming open source software was inferior or dangerous.\nThose were clear attacks that were relatively easy to resist: it was mostly\neducation and advocacy, and ultimately the quality of open source software\ncould be used to prove our point. Now it's attacked from the inside, by\ncompanies traditionally producing open source software, claiming that it\nshould change to better fit their business models. We need to go back to\nthe basics and explain why those rights and freedoms matter, and why\nblurring the lines ultimately weakens everyone. We need a strong OSI\nto lead that new fight, because it is far from over.</p>\n<h2>A taxonomy of open source production models</h2>\n<p>As I argued in previous parts, how open source is built ultimately impacts\nthe benefits users get. A lot of us know that, and we all came up with our\nown vocabulary to describe those various ways open source is produced today.</p>\n<p>Even within a given model (say open collaboration between equals on a level\nplaying field), we use different sets of principles: the OpenStack\nFoundation has the <a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/four-opens/\">4 Opens</a>\n(open source, open development, open design, open community), the Eclipse\nFoundation has the Open Source Rules of Engagement (open, transparent,\nmeritocracy), the Apache Foundation has the Apache Way... We all advocate\nfor our own variant, focusing on differences rather than what we have in\ncommon: the key benefits those variants all enable.</p>\n<p>This abundance of slightly-different vocabulary makes it difficult to rally\naround and communicate efficiently. If we have no clear way to differentiate\ngood all-benefits-included open source from twisted some-benefits-withheld\nopen source, the confusion (where all open source is considered equal)\nbenefits the twisted production models. I think it is time for us to\nregroup, and converge around <strong>a clear, common classification of open source\nproduction models</strong>.</p>\n<p>We need to classify those models based on which benefits they guarantee\nto the users of the produced software. Open-core does not guarantee\navailability, single-vendor does not provide sustainability nor does\nit allow to efficiently engage and influence the direction of the\nsoftware, while open-collaboration gives you all three.</p>\n<p>Once we have this classification, we'll need to heavily communicate around\nit, with a single voice. As long as we use slightly different terms (or\nmean slightly different things when using common terms), we maintain\nconfusion which ultimately benefits the most restrictive models.</p>\n<h2>Get together</h2>\n<p>Beyond that, I think we need to talk more. Open source conferences used to\nbe all about education and advocacy: what is this weird way of producing\nsoftware, and why you should probably be interested in it. Once open source\nbecame ubiquitous, those style of horizontal open source conferences became\nless relevant, and were soon replaced by more vertical conferences around a\nspecific stack or a specific use case.</p>\n<p>This is a good evolution: this is what winning looks like. The issue is:\n<strong>the future of open source is not discussed anymore</strong>. We rest on our\nlaurels, while the world continually evolves and adapts. Some open source\nconference islands may still exist, with high-level keynotes still raising\nthe issues, but those are generally one-way conversations.</p>\n<p>To do this important work of converging vocabulary and defining common\nstandards on how open source is produced, Twitter won't cut it. To\nbootstrap the effort we'll need to meet, get around a table and take the\ntime to discuss specific issues together. Ideally that would be done around\nsome other event(s) to avoid extra travel.</p>\n<p>And we need to do that soon. This work is becoming urgent. \"Open source\" as\na standard has lots of value because of all the user benefits traditionally\nassociated with free and open source software. That created an aura that\nall open source software still benefits from today. But that aura is\nweakening over time, thanks to twisted production models. How much more\nsingle-vendor open source can we afford until \"open source\" no longer means\nyou can engage with the community and influence the direction of the\nsoftware ?</p>\n<p>So here is my call to action, which concludes this series.</p>\n<p>In 2019, open source is more important than ever. Open source has not \"won\",\nthis is a continuous effort, and we are today at a critical junction.\nI think open source advocates and enthusiasts need to get together, defining\nclear, standard terminology on how open source software is built, and start\ncommunicate heavily around it with a single voice. And beyond that, we need\nto create forums where those questions on the future of open source are\ndiscussed. Because whatever battles you win today, the world does not stop\nevolving and adapting.</p>\n<p>Obviously I don't have all the answers. And there are lots of interesting\nquestions. It's just time we have a place to ask those questions and\ndiscuss the answers. If you are interested and want to get involved, feel\nfree to contact me.</p>",

In this post, I&#8217;ll walk through how to install it with Helm and use it to point a domain at a Kubernetes service. I&#8217;ll also cover setting up <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> using a DigitalOcean managed <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> certificate on the load&nbsp;balancer.</p>\n<p>First, a few&nbsp;assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have access to a Kubernetes cluster with&nbsp;kubectl</li>\n<li>You have the <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client\">Helm client installed&nbsp;locally</a></li>\n<li>Helm has been configured in the cluster using <a href=\"https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#tiller-and-role-based-access-control\">a service account with the correct&nbsp;permissions</a></li>\n<li>You have <code>doctl</code>, the DigitalOcean <span class=\"caps\">CLI</span>, <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl#installing-doctl\">installed&nbsp;locally</a></li>\n<li>You have a <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/networking/dns/how-to/add-domains/\">domain hosted on&nbsp;DigitalOcean</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Installing ExternalDNS with&nbsp;Helm</h2>\n<p>With all of that in place, the first thing to do is install ExternalDNS into the cluster. You will need to <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token/\">generate a DigitalOcean <span class=\"caps\">API</span> token</a> for it to use. It&#8217;s best to create a token specifically for this service rather than using one you may have in your local environment. Then run the following command replacing <code>$DO_API_TOKEN</code> with the token you&nbsp;generated:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>helm install --name external-dns \\\n  --set digitalocean.apiToken=$DO_API_TOKEN,provider=digitalocean,rbac.create=true \\\n  stable/external-dns\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You can verify that it has been successfully installed by&nbsp;running:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>$ kubectl get pods -l <span class=\"s2\">&quot;app=external-dns&quot;</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>When ready, the output should look something like&nbsp;this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nexternal-dns-68bfc948b-jhhrq   1/1       Running   0          34s\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<h2>Generating a DigitalOcean Managed <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span>&nbsp;Certificate</h2>\n<p>Next, use <code>doctl</code> to generate an <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> certificate managed by DigitalOcean making use of their Let&#8217;s Encrypt integration. Giving it a name and replacing <code>example.com</code> with your domain,&nbsp;run:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>doctl compute certificate create  --name k8s-cert \\\n  --type lets_encrypt --dns-names example.com\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>The output will include an <span class=\"caps\">ID</span> that looks something like <code>9r3e053d-da5e-4390-b7b8-0fs23486e41q</code>. You&#8217;ll need that in the next&nbsp;step.</p>\n<h2>Deploying the Kubernetes&nbsp;Service</h2>\n<p>Now you are ready to deploy your service to the Kubernetes cluster. For this example we are using an <span class=\"caps\">NGINX</span> container for the deployment, but that could be any application running in your cluster. The important part for this exercise is the LoadBalancer Service. Here is the full&nbsp;example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">kind</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Service</span>\n<span

class=\"n\">TCP</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look a little closer at the <code>annotations</code> section:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>  annotations:\n    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: &quot;example.com&quot;\n    service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-redirect-http-to-https: &quot;true&quot;\n    service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-certificate-id: &quot;9r3e053d-da5e-4390-b7b8-0fs23486e41q&quot;\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/\">Kubernetes annotations</a> are just metadata attached to a Kubernetes object. They can be used for anything from specifying a maintainer for the service to a git commit hash or other release information. They can also be used to pass on information to controllers. In our case, both the <a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager\">DigitalOcean Cloud Controller Manager</a> and the ExternalDNS controller are watching for services created with these annotations. Breaking down each&nbsp;one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname</code> - Specifies the domain name to be assigned to the&nbsp;service</li>\n<li><code>service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-certificate-id</code> - Specifies the <span class=\"caps\">ID</span> of the DigitalOcean managed <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span>&nbsp;cert</li>\n<li><code>service.beta.kubernetes.io/do-loadbalancer-redirect-http-to-https</code> - Configures the load balancer to automatically redirect clients from <span class=\"caps\">HTTP</span> to <span class=\"caps\">HTTPS</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After replacing the domain and certificate <span class=\"caps\">ID</span> in the full example and saving it to a file, apply the configuration&nbsp;with:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>kubectl apply -f path/to/https-with-domain.yaml\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>Now let&#8217;s take a quick look at the logs for ExternalDNS by&nbsp;running:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>kubectl logs \\\n  `kubectl get pod -l app=external-dns -o jsonpath=&quot;{.items[0].metadata.name}&quot;`\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>When the record has been successfully configured, you will see two lines&nbsp;like:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span>time=&quot;2019-04-04T01:19:11Z&quot; level=info msg=&quot;Changing record.&quot; action=CREATE record=example.com ttl=300 type=A zone=example.com\ntime=&quot;2019-04-04T01:19:12Z&quot; level=info msg=&quot;Changing record.&quot; action=CREATE record=example.com ttl=300 type=TXT zone=example.com\n</pre></div>\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering why it created two records. ExternalDNS uses <code>TXT</code> records to mark records that it manages. It will not modify any records without a corresponding <code>TXT</code> record.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping It&nbsp;Up</h2>\n<p>With our service successfully deployed, it will now be available at the configured domain with <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span>. If we redeploy the service latter, the <span class=\"caps\">DNS</span> record will persist even if the underlying <span class=\"caps\">IP</span> address were to change. If you&#8217;re looking for more detail, here&#8217;s some further reading for&nbsp;you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/digitalocean/digitalocean-cloud-controller-manager/tree/master/docs/controllers/services/examples\">Examples with additional configuration details for DigitalOcean load balancers using Kubernetes&nbsp;annotations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/external-dns#configuration\">The full list of configuration details for the ExternalDNS Helm&nbsp;chart</a></li>\n</ul>",

We'll need help to improve the tooling and make it useful for everyone wishing to work on proposed migration. There's a lot more that can be done, including spending time to parse <b>update_output.txt</b>&nbsp;(or better yet, a YAML representation of it) and testing package installation automatically to figure out what packages need no-change rebuilds, etc. A lot of it is integration of other tools that already exist.<br />\n<br />\nThat's where you come in.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a great way to learn a lot more about what happens to packages after they are uploaded, and what more you can do to ensure your own uploads move quickly to be accessible to all Ubuntu users; and many of the improvements can be as simple as contributing a simple test for one failure case for packages in -proposed.<br />\n<br />\nMore to come about <b>ubuntu-archive-assistant</b>. There are other subcommands in it than just \"proposed\". :)",

Saturday April 28 this year with free entry. The Flisol Bogotá 2018, is one of the largest in Latin America with the largest number of attendees.</p>\n<p>The Latin American Festival of Installation of Free Software is designed for students, academics, businessmen, workers, civil servants, enthusiasts and the general public to raise awareness of our philosophy, scope, progress and development around Free Software, and share these citizens using ICT freedoms and opportunities that this provides. In Colombia it is the 14th time it is held in Bogota since 2005.</p>\n<p>On this occasion, the festival allowed us to observe that free culture, beyond being a space for the installation of software distributions, operating systems (Linux) or programs that promote the opening of the Internet and the empowerment of people with respect to technology, is a form to contribute and build societies.</p>\n<p>There were more than 1,600 people who participated in more than 90 activities that included lectures, workshops, panels, spaces for children -FLISoL Kids-, a cinema of free culture, music, origami and much more.</p>\n<p>We had two international speakers of whom we are very grateful to have shared this wonderful experience: <strong>Nuritzi Sanchez</strong> President, Board of Directors at <em>GNOME Foundation</em>; Founding Member, Ecosystem Team Manager at Endless and <strong>Jorge Luis Batista </strong>Automatic engineer, Cuban enthusiast of <em>Open Street Map</em>.</p>\n<p>We <strong>greatly appreciate</strong> the support provided by the <strong>International Community of Ubuntu</strong> and also the <strong>Canonical</strong> <strong>team</strong> for making this possible, and we look forward to continue helping in Colombia more and more in the future.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"es\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Canonical?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Canonical</a> <a

These are used by gdb to write to memory locations in the process that we&#8217;re debugging, eg, to set breakpoints. For more information about how breakpoints work in gdb, <a href=\"https://blog.0x972.info/?d=2014/11/13/10/40/50-how-does-a-debugger-work\">this</a> blog post has some good information. Basically, gdb writes an invalid instruction to the breakpoint location and this causes a <code>SIGTRAP</code> when executed, which is intercepted by gdb. When you continue over the breakpoint, gdb writes the original instruction back, single-steps over it, re-writes the invalid instruction and then continues execution.</p>\n<p>This is an obvious way in which gdb can interfere with our process and make it crash, so I focused on these calls. I&#8217;ve filtered them out below:</p>\n<pre><code>13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77c9a44, 0x4c18de01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77c9ef8, 0xf00cde01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77cb5b8, 0x603cde01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77cb220, 0x4639de01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77d5310, 0xde01e71c) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77d5bb0, 0x6d7bde01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77d5d90, 0xe681de01) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77c9a44, 0x4c18bf00) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77cb5b8, 0x603cbf00) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77cb220, 0x4639bf00) = 0\n13:08:35 ptrace(PTRACE_POKEDATA, 21137, 0xf77d5bb0, 0x6d7bbf00) = 0\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that the first 7 of these write the same 2-byte sequence &#8211; 0xde01. These are breakpoints in code that is running in Thumb mode (see <code>arm_linux_thumb_le_breakpoint</code> in gdb/arm-linux-tdep.c in the gdb source code). 0xde01 in Thumb mode is an undefined instruction.</p>\n<p>(Note that the write to 0xf77d5310 is actually a breakpoint at 0xf77d5312, as 0xde01 appears in the 2 higher order bytes and this is little-endian).</p>\n<p>We aren&#8217;t inserting any breakpoints ourselves &#8211; these breakpoints are set automatically by gdb to monitor various events in the dynamic loader during startup. This is something I wasn&#8217;t aware of before debugging this.</p>\n<p>It may be useful to know how gdb determines the addresses on which to set breakpoints at startup. The dynamic loader exports various events as SystemTap probes, and data about these is stored in the <code>.note.stapsdt</code> ELF section. We can inspect this using <code>readelf</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>$ readelf -n /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3\n\nDisplaying notes found in: .note.gnu.build-id                                                            \n  Owner                 Data size       Description                          \n  GNU                  0x00000014       NT_GNU_BUILD_ID (unique build ID bitstring)                      \n    Build ID: 3f3b9b4bfea2654f2cedf6db2d120b4e3a39ea7e                      \n\nDisplaying notes found in: .note.stapsdt                                                                 \n  Owner                 Data size       Description \n  stapsdt              0x00000032       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)                         \n    Provider: rtld                                           \n    Name: init_start                                \n    Location: 0x00002a44, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000                                        \n    Arguments: -4@.L1204 4@[r7, #52]                      \n  stapsdt              0x0000002e       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)                         \n    Provider: rtld                                  \n    Name: init_complete                                              \n    Location: 0x00002ef8, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000                                        \n    Arguments: -4@.L1207 4@r4                                           \n  stapsdt              0x0000002e       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)                         \n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: map_failed\n    Location: 0x00004220, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[sp, #20] 4@r5\n  stapsdt              0x00000035       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: map_start\n    Location: 0x000045b8, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[r7, #252] 4@[r7, #72]\n  stapsdt              0x0000003c       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: map_complete\n    Location: 0x0000e020, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[fp, #20] 4@[r7, #36] 4@r4\n  stapsdt              0x00000036       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: reloc_start\n    Location: 0x0000e09e, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[fp, #20] 4@[r7, #36]\n  stapsdt              0x0000003e       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: reloc_complete\n    Location: 0x0000e312, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[fp, #20] 4@[r7, #36] 4@r4\n  stapsdt              0x00000037       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: unmap_start\n    Location: 0x0000ebb0, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[r7, #104] 4@[r7, #80]\n  stapsdt              0x0000003a       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: unmap_complete\n    Location: 0x0000ed90, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: -4@[r7, #104] 4@[r7, #80]\n  stapsdt              0x00000029       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: setjmp\n    Location: 0x0001201c, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: 4@r0 -4@r1 4@r14\n  stapsdt              0x00000029       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: longjmp\n    Location: 0x00012088, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: 4@r0 -4@r1 4@r4\n  stapsdt              0x00000031       NT_STAPSDT (SystemTap probe descriptors)\n    Provider: rtld\n    Name: longjmp_target\n    Location: 0x000120ba, Base: 0x00017b9c, Semaphore: 0x00000000\n    Arguments: 4@r0 -4@r1 4@r14\n</code></pre>\n<p>GDB uses this information to map events to breakpoint addresses.

extra write. This time, gdb is writing a 4-byte sequence &#8211; 0xe7f001f0 to 6 addresses. These are breakpoints for code running in ARM mode (see <code>eabi_linux_arm_le_breakpoint</code> in gdb/arm-linux-tdep.c in the gdb source code). The 2 writes to 0xf77d5310 and 0xf77d5314 are a single breakpoint at 0xf77d5312 (there are 2 writes because it is not on a 4-byte boundary).</p>\n<p>Checking the ARMv7 reference manual shows that 0xe7f001f0 is an undefined instruction in ARM mode. However, this byte sequence is decoded as the following valid instructions in Thumb mode:</p>\n<pre><code>lsl r0, r6, #7\nb #-16\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, it takes the contents of r6, does a logical shift left by 7, writes it to r0 and then does an unconditional branch backwards by 16 bytes. This is quite likely going to cause our program (in this case, the dynamic loader) to go off the rails and crash with a less than useful stacktrace, which is the behaviour we&#8217;re seeing.</p>\n<h1>Why is this happening?</h1>\n<p>The next step was to figure out why gdb is inserting the ARM breakpoint instruction sequence instead of the Thumb one. To do this, I needed to understand where the breakpoints are written, and grepping the source code suggests the <code>PTRACE_POKEDATA</code> calls happen in <code>inf_ptrace_peek_poke</code> in gdb/inf-ptrace.c (actually, you won&#8217;t find <code>PTRACE_POKEDATA</code> here &#8211; it&#8217;s <code>PT_WRITE_D</code> which is defined in /usr/include/sys/ptrace.h).</p>\n<p>Running gdb inside gdb with the dynamic loader debug symbols installed and setting a breakpoint on <code>inf_ptrace_peek_poke</code> shows me the call stack. Note that I set a breakpoint by line number, as <code>inf_ptrace_peek_poke</code> is inlined and it was the only way I could get the conditional breakpoint to work:</p>\n<pre><code>$ gdb --args gdb --command=~/test.script\n...                                                                                                                                                                \n(gdb) break ./gdb/inf-ptrace.c:578 if writebuf != 0x0                                                                                                                                                              \nBreakpoint 1 at 0x51218: file ./gdb/inf-ptrace.c, line 578.                                                                                                                                                        \n(gdb) run                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nStarting program: /usr/bin/gdb --command=\\~/test.script                                                                                                                                                            \nCannot parse expression `.L1207 4@r4'.                                                                                                                                                                             \nwarning: Probes-based dynamic linker interface failed.                                                   \nReverting to original interface.                                                                                                                                                                                   \n\n[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]                                                                                                                                                                      \nUsing host libthread_db library \"/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libthread_db.so.1\".                                                                                                                                      \nGNU gdb (Ubuntu 8.1-0ubuntu3) 8.1.0.20180409-git                                                         \nCopyright (C) 2018 Free Software Foundation, Inc.                                                        \nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;                                                                                                                                      \nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.                                                                                                                                                 \nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

(The <code>gdbarch_</code> functions provides a way for architecture independent code in gdb to call functions specific to the architecture associated with the target). Taking a look at what this does:</p>\n<pre><code>static const gdb_byte *\narm_sw_breakpoint_from_kind (struct gdbarch *gdbarch, int kind, int *size)\n{\n  struct gdbarch_tdep *tdep = gdbarch_tdep (gdbarch);\n\n  switch (kind)\n    {\n    case ARM_BP_KIND_ARM:\n      *size = tdep-&gt;arm_breakpoint_size;\n      return tdep-&gt;arm_breakpoint;\n    case ARM_BP_KIND_THUMB:\n      *size = tdep-&gt;thumb_breakpoint_size;\n      return tdep-&gt;thumb_breakpoint;\n    case ARM_BP_KIND_THUMB2:\n      *size = tdep-&gt;thumb2_breakpoint_size;\n      return tdep-&gt;thumb2_breakpoint;\n    default:\n      gdb_assert_not_reached (\"unexpected arm breakpoint kind\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, <code>arm_breakpoint_from_kind</code> returns an ARM, Thumb or Thumb2 breakpoint instruction sequence depending on the value of <code>kind</code>. If we switch to frame 9, we should be able to inspect the value of <code>kind</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) f 9\n#9  0x00590c8e in default_memory_insert_breakpoint (gdbarch=&lt;optimized out&gt;, bp_tgt=0x9236f0) at ./gdb/mem-break.c:66\n66      ./gdb/mem-break.c: No such file or directory.\n(gdb) p bp_tgt-&gt;kind\n$2 = 2\n</code></pre>\n<p>2 is <code>ARM_BP_KIND_THUMB</code>, so this appears to check out. Moving further up the stack, we find that <code>kind</code> is determined in frame 10 (<code>bkpt_insert_location</code> in gdb/breakpoint.c). Let&#8217;s have a look at what that does:</p>\n<pre><code>static int\nbkpt_insert_location (struct bp_location *bl)\n{\n  CORE_ADDR addr = bl-&gt;target_info.reqstd_address;\n\n  bl-&gt;target_info.kind = breakpoint_kind (bl, &amp;addr);\n  bl-&gt;target_info.placed_address = addr;\n\n  if (bl-&gt;loc_type == bp_loc_hardware_breakpoint)\n    return target_insert_hw_breakpoint (bl-&gt;gdbarch, &amp;bl-&gt;target_info);\n  else\n    return target_insert_breakpoint (bl-&gt;gdbarch, &amp;bl-&gt;target_info);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This calls <code>breakpoint_kind</code>, which delegates to <code>arm_breakpoint_kind_from_pc</code> in gdb/arm-tdep.c via <code>gdbarch_breakpoint_kind_from_pc</code>. <code>arm_breakpoint_kind_from_pc</code> maps the breakpoint address to an instruction set and returns one of three values &#8211; <code>ARM_BP_KIND_ARM</code>, <code>ARM_BP_KIND_THUMB</code> or <code>ARM_BP_KIND_THUMB2</code>. From looking at <code>arm_breakpoint_kind_from_pc</code>, we can see the most interesting part is a call to <code>arm_pc_is_thumb</code>. Let&#8217;s have a look at how this works:</p>\n<pre><code>int\narm_pc_is_thumb (struct gdbarch *gdbarch, CORE_ADDR memaddr)\n{\n  struct bound_minimal_symbol sym;\n  char type;\n  ...\n\n  /* If bit 0 of the address is set, assume this is a Thumb address.  */\n  if (IS_THUMB_ADDR (memaddr))\n    return 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, first of all it checks whether bit 0 of the breakpoint address is set. Looking at the SystemTap probes in <code>.note.stapsdt</code> from our earlier <code>readelf</code> output, we can see that this is not the case for any probe. Following on:</p>\n<pre><code>  /* If the user wants to override the symbol table, let him.  */\n  if (strcmp (arm_force_mode_string, \"arm\") == 0)\n    return 0;\n  if (strcmp (arm_force_mode_string, \"thumb\") == 0)\n    return 1;\n\n  /* ARM v6-M and v7-M are always in Thumb mode.  */\n  if (gdbarch_tdep (gdbarch)-&gt;is_m)\n    return 1;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We&#8217;re not forcing the mode and this isn&#8217;t ARM v6-M or v7-M, so, continuing:</p>\n<pre><code>  /* If there are mapping symbols, consult them.  */\n  type = arm_find_mapping_symbol (memaddr, NULL);\n  if (type)\n    return type == 't';\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>arm_find_mapping_symbol</code> tries to find a mapping symbol associated with the breakpoint address. Mapping symbols are a special type of symbol used to identify transitions between ARM and Thumb instruction sets (see <a href=\"http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0474f/CHDGFCDI.html\">this</a> information). Breaking here in gdb shows that there isn&#8217;t a mapping symbol associated with the <code>init_start</code> probe:</p>\n<pre><code>(gdb) break ./gdb/arm-tdep.c:434\nBreakpoint 2 at 0x43ec3c: file ./gdb/arm-tdep.c, line 434.\n(gdb) run\n...\n\nBreakpoint 2, arm_pc_is_thumb (gdbarch=gdbarch@entry=0x928fb0, memaddr=memaddr@entry=4152138308) at ./gdb/arm-tdep.c:434\n434     ./gdb/arm-tdep.c: No such file or directory.\n(gdb) p/x memaddr\n$2 = 0xf77c9a44\n(gdb) p type\n$3 = 0 '\\000'\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, continuing to the next step:</p>\n<pre><code>  /* Thumb functions have a \"special\" bit set in minimal symbols.  */\n  sym = lookup_minimal_symbol_by_pc (memaddr);\n  if (sym.minsym)\n    return (MSYMBOL_IS_SPECIAL (sym.minsym));\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>lookup_minimal_symbol_by_pc</code> tries to map the breakpoint address to a function symbol. <code>MSYMBOL_IS_SPECIAL(sym.minsym)</code> expands to <code>sym.minsym-&gt;target_flag_1</code> and is 1 if bit 0 of the symbol&#8217;s target address is set, indicating that the function is called in Thumb mode (see <code>arm_elf_make_msymbol_special</code> in gdb/arm-tdep.c for where this is set).

Vast majority of that was some form of <a href=\"https://www.openstack.org/\">OpenStack</a>, either a simple cloud or a complicated one. But when you think about it &#8211; what is a simple cloud? It&#8217;s easy to say that small amount of machines makes an easy, and large amount of machines makes a complicated cloud. But, that is not true. Complexity of a typical IaaS solution is pretty much determined by network complexity. Network, in all shapes and forms, from the underlay network to the customer&#8217;s overlay network requirements. I&#8217;ll try to explain how we deal with the underlay part in this blog.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a secret that a traditional tree like network architecture just doesn&#8217;t work for cloud environments. There are multiple reasons why; it doesn&#8217;t scale very well, it requires big OSI layer 2 domains and&#8230; well, it&#8217;s based on OSI layer 2. Debugging issues on that level is never a joyful experience. Therefore, for IaaS environments one really wants to do a modern design in a form of a spine-leaf architecture. Layer 3 spine-leaf architecture. This allows us to have bunch of smaller layer 2 domains, which then nicely correlate to availability zones, power zones, etc. However, managing environments with multiple layer 2 and therefore even more layer 3 domains requires a bit of rethinking. If we truly want to be effective in deploying and operating a cloud across multiple different layer 2 domains we need to think of the network in a bit more abstract mode. Luckily, this is nothing new.</p>\n<p>In traditional approach to network, we talk about TORs, management fabric, BMC/OOB fabric, etc. These are most of the time layer 2 concepts. Fabric, after all, is a collection of switches. But the approach is correct; we should always talk about networks in abstract terms. Instead of talking about subnets and VLANs, we should talk about purpose of the network. This becomes important when we talk about spine-leaf architecture and multiple different subnets that serve the same purpose. In rack 1, subnet 172.16.1.0/24 is management network, but in rack 2, management network is on subnet 192.168.1.0/24, and so on. It&#8217;s obvious that it&#8217;s much nicer to abstract those subnets into a &#8216;management network&#8217;. Still, nothing new. We do this every day.</p>\n<p>So&#8230; Why do our tools and applications still require us to use VLANs, subnets and IPs? If we deploy same application across different racks, why do we have to keep separate configurations for each of the units of the same application? What we really want is to have all of our Keystones listening on OpenStack Public API network, and not on subnets 192.168.10.0/24, 192.168.20.0/24 and 192.168.30.0/24. We end up thinking about application on a network, but we configure differently exact copies of the same application (units) on different subnets. Clearly our configuration tools are not doing what we want, but rather forcing us to transform our way of thinking into what those tools need. It&#8217;s a paradox that OpenStack is not that complicated, rather it&#8217;s made complicated by the tools used to deploy it.</p>\n<p>While trying to solve this problem in our deployments at Canonical, we came up with concept of <strong>spaces</strong>. A space would be this abstracted network that we have in our heads, but somehow fail to put into our tools. Again, spaces are not a revolutionary concept in networking, they have been in our heads all this time. So, how do we implement spaces at Canonical?</p>\n<p>We have grown concept of spaces across all of our tooling; <a href=\"https://maas.io/\">MAAS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/juju\">juju</a> and <a href=\"https://jujucharms.com/\">charms</a>. When we configure MAAS to manage our bare metal machines, we do not define networks as subnets or VLANs, we rather define networks as spaces. A space has a purpose, description and few other attributes. VLANs, and indirectly subnets too, become properties of the space, instead of other way around. This also means that when we deploy a machine, we deploy it connected to a space. When we deploy a machine, we usually do not deploy it on a specific network, but rather with specific requirements; must be able to talk to X, must have Y CPU and Z RAM. If you ever asked yourself why does it take so much time to rack and stack a server, it&#8217;s because of this disconnect of what we want and how we handle the configuration.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also enabled Juju to make this kind of requests &#8211; it asks MAAS for machines that is connected to a space, or set of spaces. It then exposes this spaces to charms, so that each charm knows what kind of networks this application has on its disposal. This allows us to do &#8216;juju deploy keystone &#8211;bind public=public-space -n3&#8217;; deploy three keystones, connect them to a public-space, a space defined in MAAS. What VLAN will that be, which subnet or an IP, we do not care; the charm will get information from Juju about these &#8220;low level&#8221; terms (VLANs, IPs). We humans do not think of VLANs and subnets and IPs; at best we think in OSI layer 1 terms.</p>\n<p>Sounds a bit complicated? Let&#8217;s flip it the other way around. What I can do now is define my application as &#8220;3 units of keystone, which use internal network for SQL, public network for exposing API, internal network for OpenStack&#8217;s internal communication and is also exposed on OAM network for management purposes&#8221; and this is precisely how we deploy OpenStack. In fact, the Juju bundle looks like this:</p>\n<p><code>keystone:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;charm: cs:keystone<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;num_units: 3<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;bindings:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"\": oam-space<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public: public-space<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internal: internal-space<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shared-db: internal-space<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Those who follow OpenStack development will notice that something similar has landed in OpenStack recently; routed provider networks. It&#8217;s the same concept, solving the same problem. It&#8217;s nice to see how Juju uses this out of the box.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to MAAS, Juju, charms and OpenStack communities for doing this. It allowed us to deploy complex applications with a breeze, and therefore shifted our focus to bigger picture, IaaS modeling and some other, new challenges!</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>Xubuntu 17.10 was just released, but planning for Xubuntu 18.04 – the next long-term support (LTS) release – began quite some time ago. For our users, LTS releases mostly mean a system that is going to be more stable and supported for longer. For us contributors, this means a bunch of things.</p>\n<p>As a repercussion of the longer support cycle and the sought out stable nature of the LTS releases, we do not want to introduce (too many) new components, libraries or other technical changes, as each change has regression potential. This is also a delicate balancing act between getting bugs fixed but keeping enough things as they are.</p>\n<p>The LTS releases are also kind of an flagship for Xubuntu – they are the recommended releases for most users and while we can land stable release updates (SRU) to fix bugs and other major flaws, the scope of changes is limited. Since the next LTS release will be released two years later, we want to get things right.</p>\n<p>For contributors – particularly us non-developer kinds – this is an ideal situation to revisit and improve artwork and documentation amongst other things. Here are some things I am going to be working on for the next months to get the new LTS look and feel more polished than the previous one.</p>\n<h2>Branding – or, updated logo</h2>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://open.knome.fi/2017/10/20/refreshing-xubuntu-logo/\">earlier article</a> I wrote about the refreshed Xubuntu logo – the why and the what. Here&#8217;s the other what.</p>\n<p>Practically this change means we will have to touch every package with Xubuntu branding and make sure they use the updated logo. For the most part this is trivial, but landing the changes requires time and some co-operation from the team.</p>\n<p>We will also need to make sure the new logo lands on the official website, all related sites and social media before the release – ideally before the first milestone release. Last but not least, we need to communicate this change to our official vendors and provide them the new logo as soon as possible so they can start updating their products.</p>\n<h2>Wallpapers</h2>\n<p>As with any release, the LTS release also needs a wallpaper. This needs to be drafted, proposed and polished. The process usually takes from a few days to a few weeks. We&#8217;ll also want to land the wallpaper relatively early to be able to fix potential issues with it before release.</p>\n<p>The Xubuntu team has organized a community wallpaper contest for the last two LTS releases and it&#8217;s very likely we will be organizing one for 18.04 as well. I was not completely satisfied in how we ran the contest last time, and I&#8217;ve started a discussion to review our policies already, as getting comments from the team can sometimes be quite slow. While the community wallpaper package does not serve any defaults, we will need to end the contest well before the related freezes to double check license issues (like attribution) and leave enough time for uploading them.</p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p>Even if there is no need to rewrite sections – or the whole documentation – this time around, there are several tasks for the documentation team as well.</p>\n<p>First of all, it&#8217;s time to refresh both the installer slideshow and the website feature tour. Nothing has been planned yet, but both of these are at least two years old and in need of a facelift – both visually and in terms of content.</p>\n<p>We haven&#8217;t had to touch the documentation much in a long time because the main software selection and features have stayed the same. On the other hand this means that the documentation might be somewhat stale. This might be hard to identify – and possibly even harder to get stale sections refreshed – but we definitely should have a look at our offering before the release. To do this, we need to consider the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the documentation provide a good overview of the system for new users?</li>\n<li>Does the documentation help users get started?</li>\n<li>Does the documentation answer the most common questions?</li>\n<li>Does the documentation help get the most common (non-hardware specific) issues solved?</li>\n<li>Does the documentation help more advanced users – including those that are familiar with other Linux operating systems but not Xubuntu?</li>\n<li>Is all information in the documentation up-to-date?</li>\n<li>Does the documentation need extending in any area?</li>\n<li>Can we extend the documentation in a useful way without making it too verbose?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>But wait! There&#8217;s more!</h2>\n<p>My work item list for Xubuntu 18.04 doesn&#8217;t end here. You can find all of the registered work items on our <a href=\"https://dev.xubuntu.org/\">status tracker</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that not all of the work items in the status tracker have an assignee. This means we are still looking for people who can help us make Xubuntu 18.04 a greater release than its predecessors. <em>Maybe you can volunteer and pick up a work item or two?</em></p>\n<p>In addition to the work items, there are a few other activities that we need help with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Test.</strong> By testing the daily and milestone ISOs you can help us make sure there aren&#8217;t (so many) annoying bugs in the final release.</li>\n<li><strong>Take part in the community wallpaper contest</strong>.

There is an <a href=\"http://www.justgohome.co.uk/blog/2017/07/developing-ubuntu-using-git.html#multi-post-index\">index of all our planned posts in the first\npost</a>.\nAs mentioned there, it is important to keep in mind that <a href=\"http://www.justgohome.co.uk/blog/2017/07/developing-ubuntu-using-git.html#experimental-status\">the tooling\nand implementation are still highly\nexperimental</a>.</p>\n<p>Nish introduced our imported repositories <a href=\"https://naccblog.wordpress.com/2017/08/01/git-ubuntu-clone/\">using the <code>git ubuntu clone</code>\nwrapper</a>, as well\nas using git directly.</p>\n<p>I'd like to go into a little more detail about what we're actually importing.</p>\n<p>Automatic imports watch for new source publications in Launchpad. When they\noccur, the importer will push new commits and tags to match those publications\nand move up branch pointers automatically. All branches maintained by the\nimporter are fast-forwarding. A temporary exception to this is during our\nexperimental stage, before we release a 1.0. Until then, we may re-import\npackages as we work on the importer.</p>\n<p>Our importer maintains one repository per source package in\n<a href=\"https://code.launchpad.net/~usd-import-team/+git\">lp:~usd-import-team</a> for\nnow. Eventually we expect to make these available under an alias of the form\n<code>lp:ubuntu/+source/&lt;package&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>The imported trees correctly reflect the ancestry of individual source\npackages. This includes both Debian and Ubuntu history, with Ubuntu history\ncorrectly parented from the appropriate points in Debian's history.</p>\n<p>There is a branch corresponding to each Debian and Ubuntu series (eg. <code>sid</code>,\n<code>stretch</code>, <code>xenial</code>, <code>artful</code>), and in the case of Ubuntu, pocket (eg.\n<code>trusty-updates</code>, <code>xenial-security</code>, <code>artful-proposed</code>). We’ll cover details on\nhow exactly these work, and the logic behind their design, in future posts.</p>\n<h2>Single source of truth</h2>\n<p>A goal of the importer is to reflect the single source of truth, which\nwe define as Launchpad's source publication history. Therefore, the only\nsource of the imported tags and branches must come via the importer and\nnot directly from uploaders. Only the importer can push to the imported\nrepositories. We do have a mechanism to preserve \"rich history\" provided\nby git committers that in any other project they'd be able to push\ndirectly; more on this in a future post.</p>\n<p>Note that this methodology means that upstream's commit graphs are typically\nnot made available by the importer. You won't find individual upstream commits\nby looking in our imported respository against a particular package. We may\ndecide to make this possible in the future by relying on the \"rich history\"\nimport mechanism combined with the use of our parenting invariant. More on this\nin a future post.</p>\n<p>We're trying hard to make sure that there is no case where a source package\nupload can cause the importer to fail. We're treating any failure to import a\nsource package as a bug in our importer. The importer should be able to import\nanything that was ever uploaded to Debian or Ubuntu.</p>\n<h2>Available branches</h2>\n<p>As Nish mentioned, there are two main types of branches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Devel branches: the branches on which to start development.</li>\n<li>Pocket branches: understanding the current state of the archive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are also \"applied\" versions of these branches, which provide quilt\npatches already applied.</p>\n<h3>The \"devel\" branches</h3>\n<p>Ubuntu developers are used to using <code>pull-lp-source</code> to grab the latest version\nof a package source on which to base development. We want to make <code>git clone</code>\nwork instead.</p>\n<p>What is the correct version on which to base development? In Ubuntu,\nthis can vary depending on the exact publication state. Usually you want\nthe highest version published in the development release, or the highest\nversion published in a particular series for an\n<a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates\">SRU</a>. For this purpose,\nthe git importer maintains <code>devel</code> branches. For the development\nrelease, this is just called <code>ubuntu/devel</code>. For a stable release, it is\n<code>ubuntu/&lt;codename&gt;-devel</code>; for example: <code>ubuntu/xenial-devel</code>.</p>\n<p>This is intended to save developers the effort of figuring out which pocket to\nuse (between the release pocket, <code>proposed</code>, <code>updates</code> and <code>security</code>) and\nsaves scripts from having to figure it out themselves.</p>\n<p>One exception to this is in the rare case that a version in the proposed pocket\nhas been discarded, such as a failed SRU. The importer only follows new version\npublications and does not follow deletions. In this case you may wish to start\ndirectly from a pocket branch (described below). Alternatively, before you\nbegin you could start from the devel branch and use <code>git revert</code> to add a\ncommit reversing the published change in line with the deletion. The\ninfrastructure doesn’t care which method you choose.</p>\n<h3>Pocket branches</h3>\n<p>A different use case is to look at the git branches to understand what the\narchive looks like today, or how it looked in the past.</p>\n<h4>Ubuntu’s pockets</h4>\n<p>First let’s review what Ubuntu pockets actually are.</p>\n<p>In Ubuntu, the archive for a particular release (“series”) is divided up into a\nnumber of “pockets”, which correspond to the entries in your <code>sources.list</code>\nfile:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The release pocket. This pocket has no specific name. During\n    development, the release pocket is where package eventually land.\n    Upon release, this pocket is frozen and never changes again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “proposed” pocket. This pocket is used for two different\n    purposes depending on whether the series is in development or has\n    been released. During development, this is the staging area in which\n    packages are built, tested and checked for installability before\n    they land. When all tests pass, packages are moved into the release\n    pocket in a process called <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration\">proposed\n    migration</a>. After\n    release, the proposed pocket is used for a different purpose: manual\n    user verification of proposed stable release updates through the\n    <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Verification\">SRU verification\n    process</a>.\n    When a package passes SRU verification, the package is moved into\n    the updates pocket, rather than the release pocket is as the case\n    during development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “updates” pocket. Only used for stable releases, this pocket is\n    used to issue recommended updates to users during the lifetime of a\n    stable release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The “security” pocket. Only used for stable releases, this pocket is\n    used to issue security updates to users during the lifetime of a\n    stable release. Updates to the security pocket are always also\n    copied into the updates pocket.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The name of a pocket is in the form <code>&lt;series&gt;-&lt;type&gt;</code>, such as\n<code>xenial-security</code> and <code>artful-updates</code>. As an exception, the release pocket is\nthe series with no suffix, such as <code>trusty</code>.</p>\n<h4>Importing pockets into git</h4>\n<p>The importer maintains a branch for each pocket, in the form <code>ubuntu/&lt;pocket\nname&gt;</code>, such as <code>ubuntu/trusty</code> (the Trusty release pocket),\n<code>ubuntu/xenial-security</code>, <code>ubuntu/artful-proposed</code> and so on.</p>\n<h3>Combining pocket branches: the devel branches</h3>\n<p>To support the archeology use case, the importer must maintain these pocket\nbranches. However, for the ongoing development use case, it's far more\nconvenient for developers to use our \"devel branches\".</p>\n<p>We do this by making use of our \"parenting invariant\", which we’ll describe in\nmore detail in a future post. For now, it’s sufficient to understand that the\ndevel branches are the points at which you should start development, and the\npocket branches can be used to examine the current state of the various pockets\nin the Ubuntu archive.</p>\n<h3>Applied branches</h3>\n<p>For our drive-by contributor use case, it would be nice if these drive-by\ncontributors didn't have to understand quilt. It's reasonable to expect that,\nstraight after running <code>git clone</code> from Ubuntu and selecting an appropriate\nbranch, the tree that appears is exactly the source used to build the\ncorresponding Ubuntu package. For drive-by contributors unfamiliar with Debian\npackaging, this means that quilt patches should appear applied. Our \"applied\"\nbranches and tags provide this function.</p>\n<p>The non-applied branches are the normative imports from Debian and Ubuntu\ndeveloper uploads. They are intended to represent the source package exactly\nand without any derived components. This means that quilt patches appear in\n<code>debian/patches/</code> as normal, but are not applied.</p>\n<p>From one of these import commits, all quilt patches (if any) are applied one by\none. Each application results in a separate git commit. A final commit with an\nidentical tree is added for branch fast-forwarding purposes, and these commits\nform the line of the \"applied\" branch.</p>\n<p>Consequently, you can switch to an \"applied\" branch, or corresponding tag, and\nyou'll see the state of the Ubuntu source package with all patches applied and\nas if quilt doesn't exist. Drive-by contributors can then file pull requests\nagainst such a branch (eg. <code>applied/ubuntu/devel</code>) and bots and sponsors will\nbe able to understand exactly what is being requested.</p>\n<p>It will often be necessary to pull out requested changes into a separate\nquilt patch, add <a href=\"http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/\">dep3</a> headers, and\npossibly squash the requested change into an existing quilt patch,\nbefore uploading. We hope to automate some of this in the future, but\nfor now this is left as a task for sponsors who accept git workflow\nupload requests. Contributors can either submit pull requests against\nthe applied branches this way, or fold up into quilt patches themselves\nand submit pull requests against the non-applied branches instead.</p>\n<p>In the future, it may be desirable for all Ubuntu developers to forget quilt\nand live entirely inside git-based patchsets. For the time being, we want to\nsupport both traditional and git-based workflows. So both applied and\nnon-applied branches are maintained by the importer.</p>\n<p>It is a matter of debate as to whether the non-applied or applied branches\nshould appear by default. We are open to further discussion on this.</p>\n<h2>Available tags</h2>\n<p>The first time the importer imports a new version of a source package, it tags\nit using an \"import tag\", which is of the form <code>import/&lt;version&gt;</code>. The\npatches-applied equivalent is derived, and the result is tagged in the form\n<code>applied/&lt;version&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>Pocket copies, such as from Debian into Ubuntu via autosync, are not tagged;\nthe pocket branches are moved forward with new commits (with identical trees)\nas necessary.</p>\n<p>Since not all valid package version strings are valid git tag names, the tag\nnames are escaped using the same rules as specified in\n<a href=\"http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep14/\">dep14</a>, Debian's recommendation on git\nrepository layouts.</p>\n<p>We use tags of the form <code>upload/&lt;version&gt;</code> to supply rich history for adoption\ninto the imported commit graph. This cannot be pushed directly; more on this in\na future post.</p>\n<p>To support the preservation of orig tarballs using pristine tar, the importer\nalso tags <code>upstream/&lt;version&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>pristine-tar and the dsc branches</h2>\n<p>So that the git repositories contain all the information needed to reconstruct\nan imported source package, the importer also stores the orig tarballs using\npristine-tar and the signed dsc file in separate branches. Orig tarballs are\nautomatically extracted on package build as needed by the <code>git ubuntu build</code>\nwrapper. This means that <code>git ubuntu clone</code> followed by <code>git ubuntu build</code>\nshould Just Work.</p>\n<p>Orig tarballs between Debian and Ubuntu may vary in exceptional cases, so the\nimporter keeps these properly namespaced in <code>debian/pristine-tar</code> and\n<code>ubuntu/pristine-tar</code> branches to avoid collisions, and likewise for the dsc\nfiles <code>debian/dsc</code> and <code>ubuntu/dsc</code>. pristine-tar doesn't currently support\nmultiple branches; it assumes a single branch of <code>pristine-tar</code>. Our <code>git\nubuntu build</code> wrapper works around this for now. In the future I'd like for us\nto drive getting parameterised branch name support into <code>pristine-tar</code> upstream\nto support our use case.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In order to provide a full understanding of what we're doing to those\ndevelopers interested in all the detail, I've tried to cover all the git\nreference objects presented by our importer in this post today.</p>\n<p>In our next post, Nish will continue discussing the <code>git ubuntu</code> tooling by\nintroducing <code>git ubuntu tag</code>.</p>",

Specifically, it will be GNOME (including gnome-shell) with minimal Ubuntu customization. Next year, if you are using either Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 LTS, you will be prompted to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. For normal release users, this upgrade should happen with the release of 17.10.</p>\n<p>As a result of this decision there will no longer be a separate GNOME flavor of Ubuntu. The development teams from both Ubuntu GNOME and Ubuntu Desktop will be merging resources and focusing on a single combined release, that provides the best of both GNOME and Ubuntu. We are currently liaising with the Canonical teams on how this will work out and more details will be announced in due course as we work out the specifics.</p>\n<p>The Ubuntu community is important to Mark Shuttleworth and he has publicly stated on <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+MarkShuttleworthCanonical/posts/7LYubpaHUHH\" target=\"_blank\">Google+</a>: <em>&#8220;We will invest in Ubuntu GNOME with the intent of delivering a fantastic all-GNOME desktop. We&#8217;re helping the Ubuntu GNOME team, not creating something different or competitive with that effort. While I am passionate about the design ideas in Unity, and hope GNOME may be more open to them now, I think we should respect the GNOME design leadership by delivering GNOME the way GNOME wants it delivered.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The Ubuntu GNOME developers were already members of the Ubuntu Desktop team since both teams shared responsibility for maintaining many parts of GNOME. We will continue to work closely with them and push the visions of Ubuntu GNOME into the main Ubuntu Community.</p>\n<p>We started and maintained Ubuntu GNOME with the vision of bringing the most popular desktop experience<sup>1</sup> to the most popular Linux distribution. We are excited that we are now able to bring this powerful combination to many more people. If you want an early preview of what this will look like, try Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 today!</p>\n<p>On behalf of the Ubuntu GNOME team,<br />\nJeremy Bicha and Tim Lunn</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> GNOME is shipped as the default desktop on a majority of Linux distributions.</p>",

Sure, we could have went to 18 different source package pages and just clicked our way to it, but that kind of takes a darn while. </p>\n<p>Luckily there's a solution: <a href=\"https://help.launchpad.net/API/launchpadlib\">launchpadlib</a>. Just a <code>pip install</code> away (or use package python-launchpadlib), it gives you all sorts of control over and access to Launchpad data. It's almost better than using the web interface! Well, assuming you're fine with Python.</p>\n<p>In our case here, it's possible to simply name a team and/or person and give it a list of packages and have it subscribe them all. Takes a few seconds after you have the code, which you can find <a href=\"https://github.com/tsimonq2/masspackagelp\">here</a>. The meat of the code is one line:</p>\n<div class=\"pygments_monokai syntax_highlight\"><pre><span class=\"n\">lp</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">distributions</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;ubuntu&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">]</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">getSourcePackage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">filearray</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">])</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">addBugSubscription</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">subscriber</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">lp</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">people</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">teamtowrite</span><span class=\"p\">])</span><br/></pre></div>\n\n<p>which is basically like saying for a particular source package in the Ubuntu project, add a bug subscription for the particular team or person. Heck, it almost reads like normal English.</p>\n<p>This might be useful for normal people, too. Say you wanted to subscribe to all the bugs for a particular set of packages you're helping to develop. It'd be great for that. </p>\n<p>More than anything, it shows the power of the Launchpad API and the hard work that Colin and the rest of the Launchpad team put into it!</p>\n<p>With that, I'd like to especially thank cjwatson, dobey, and wgrant, whom were all helpful in figuring this out on IRC, as well as <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/tsimonq2\">tsimonq2</a>, who was responsible for the majority of the code.</p>",

CeTA is developing a number of very exciting projects, and the one I had the pleasure to work on is <strong>AlgAudio</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/JQU8xWD.png\" alt=\"screenshot\" width=\"674\" height=\"800\" /></p>\n<p><em>(download links available below)</em></p>\n<p>AlgAudio is a new signal processing framework that we&#8217;ve been developing from scratch. The user builds an audio processing network by placing &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of simple operations, connecting them together, configuring their parameters, and defining how the parameters should influence each other. The network works in real time, so any changes to the parameters are immediately reflected in the outputted audio. This makes AlgAudio a perfect tool for live performances.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-385\"></span></p>\n<p>The general concept was inspired by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_%28software%29\">Max/MSP</a>, but AlgAudio is intended to provide a higher-level interface. It is supposed to be used by musicians, so we do our best to make it easy to work with without any programming or mathematical skills. The building blocks usually represent a more complex operation (comparing to Max or PureData), and expose a number of parameters that can be manually configured, or controlled live via an external controller.</p>\n<p>At this stage, AlgAudio is ready to be tried out. Most core features are already implemented, so you can actually build really interesting synthesizers. However, there is still a lot to be done. Most importantly, the module collections need expansion (currently only the very basic modules are available, for example there are no audio filtering blocks available ATM), the module browser needs a better hierarchical structure, we are missing a number of parameter connecting modes, the UI needs various improvements, subpatching and polyphonic features need improvements, and we need a test framework to ensure top quality.</p>\n<p>We also believe that creating external modules should be very simple, so that third-parties can provide their own module collections. The API is not quite stable yet, but we&#8217;re getting there. This is what an example module looks like:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n  &lt;module id=&quot;mix3&quot; name=&quot;3ch mixer&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;params&gt;\r\n      &lt;inlet id=&quot;in1&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;inlet id=&quot;in2&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;inlet id=&quot;in3&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;outlet id=&quot;out&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/params&gt;\r\n    &lt;description&gt; This module mixes three channels together. &lt;/description&gt;\r\n    &lt;sc&gt;\r\narg in1, in2, in3, out;\r\nvar sum = In.ar(in1) + In.ar(in2) + In.ar(in3); \r\nOut.ar(out, sum);\r\n    &lt;/sc&gt;\r\n    &lt;gui type=&quot;standard auto&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;/module&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<p>But what if you would like to inject custom features? AlgAudio has a built-in plugin system. Each module may come with custom logic. The C++ interface allows interaction with literally any other AlgAudio component (you might even get as far as to, say, get your module to modify how other modules are displayed!). Below is the source of a simple module that sums the values of two parameters, and outputs the result as a third parameter.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nclass DataSum : public AlgAudio::Module{\r\n  void on_param_set(std::string name, float value){\r\n    float v  = GetParamControllerByID(&quot;input1&quot;)-&gt;Get();\r\n          v += GetParamControllerByID(&quot;input2&quot;)-&gt;Get();\r\n    GetParamControllerByID(&quot;output&quot;)-&gt;Set(v);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n</pre>\n<p>This source code should be pretty self-explanatory. Does it get much more complex? Here&#8217;s a sequencer module that outputs a hard-coded sequence:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: cpp; title: ; notranslate\">\r\nclass SimpleSeq : public AlgAudio::Module{\r\npublic:\r\n  int i = 7;\r\n  int seq[8] = {60, 62, 64, 65, 64, 62, 69, 67};\r\n  const  float fill = 0.8;\r\n  void on_init(){\r\n    step();\r\n  }\r\n  void step(){\r\n    i = (i+1)%8;\r\n    int note = seq[i];\r\n    float period = GetParamControllerByID(&quot;period&quot;)-&gt;Get();\r\n    GetParamControllerByID(&quot;freq&quot;)-&gt;Set( AlgAudio::Utilities::mtof(note) );\r\n    GetParamControllerByID(&quot;gate&quot;)-&gt;Set(1.0f);\r\n    timerhandles += AlgAudio::Timer::Schedule(period * fill, [this](){\r\n      GetParamControllerByID(&quot;gate&quot;)-&gt;Set(0.0f);\r\n    });\r\n    timerhandles += AlgAudio::Timer::Schedule(period, [this](){\r\n      step();\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n};\r\n</pre>\n<p>You can browse the API <a href=\"http://cielak.org/algaudio/doc/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We are releasing AlgAudio under the terms of the <strong>Lesser GNU General Public License</strong>, so you&#8217;ll be free to use it however you like.

My goal was to assign lower CPU shares to the build processes (debomatic itself, sbuild, and all the related tools), in order to avoid blocking other important system services from being spawned when necessary.</p>\n<p>I created a new <a href=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.slice.html\">slice</a>, and set a lower CPU share weight:<br />\n<code>$ cat /etc/systemd/system/debomatic.slice<br />\n[Slice]<br />\nCPUAccounting=true<br />\nCPUShares=512<br />\n$<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Then, I assigned the slice to the service unit file controlling debomatic daemons by adding the <em>Slice=debomatic.slice</em> option under the <em>Service</em> directive.</p>\n<p>That was not enough, though, as some processes were assigned to the user slice instead, which groups all the processes spawned by users:<br />\n<img src=\"https://dktrkranz.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/systemd-cgls.png?w=700\" alt=\"systemd-cgls\" /></p>\n<p>This is probably because schroot spawns a login shell, and systemd considers it belonging to a different process group. So, I had to launch the command <em>systemctl set-property user.slice CPUShares=512</em>, so all processes belonging to the user.slice will receive the same share of the debomatic ones. I consider this a workaround, I&#8217;m open to suggestions how to properly solve this issue <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try to explore more options in the coming days, so I can improve my knowledge of systemd a little bit more <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>",

That's the third one, after <a href=\"https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/datastack/blog/2014/05/11/prove-your-chops-rulethestack-at-openstack-summit\">Atlanta</a> a year ago and <a href=\"https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/datastack/blog/2014/11/02/another-chance-to-prove-your-chops-rulethestack-at-openstack-summit-paris\">Paris</a> six months ago. In case you missed earlier episodes, SUSE won the two previous contests with <a href=\"https://github.com/dirkmueller\">Dirk</a> being <a href=\"https://communities.intel.com/community/itpeernetwork/datastack/blog/2014/06/11/the-first-ruler-of-the-stack-from-openstack-summit\">pretty</a> <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/communities/conversations/suse-rules-the-stack-by-a-mile/\">fast</a> in Atlanta and <a href=\"http://blog.adamspiers.org/\">Adam</a> <a href=\"http://blog.adamspiers.org/2014/11/05/ruler-of-the-stack/\">completing the HA challenge</a> so we could <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/communities/conversations/suse-rules-stack/\">keep the crown</a>. So of course, we had to try again!</p>\n\n\n<p>For this contest, the rules came with a list of penalties and bonuses which made it easier for people to participate. And indeed, there were quite a number of participants with the schedule for booking slots being nearly full. While deploying Kilo was a goal, you could go with older releases getting a 10 minutes penalty per release (so +10 minutes for Juno, +20 minutes for Icehouse, and so on). In a similar way, the organizers wanted to see some upgrade and encouraged that with a bonus that could significantly impact the results (-40 minutes) — nobody tried that, though.</p>\n\n\n<p>And guess what? SUSE kept the crown again. But we also went ahead with a new challenge: outperforming everyone else not just once, but twice, with two totally different methods.</p>\n\n\n<p>For the super-fast approach, <a href=\"https://github.com/dirkmueller\">Dirk</a> built again an appliance that has everything pre-installed and that configures the software on boot. This is actually not too difficult thanks to the amazing <a href=\"https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:KIWI\">Kiwi tool</a> and all the knowledge we have accumulated through the years at SUSE about building appliances, and also the <a href=\"https://github.com/SUSE-Cloud/openstack-quickstart\">small scripts</a> we use for the CI of our OpenStack packages. Still, it required some work to adapt the setup to the contest and also to make sure that our Kilo packages (that were brand new and without much testing) were fully working. The clock result was 9 minutes and 6 seconds, resulting in a negative time of minus 10 minutes and 54 seconds (yes, the text in the picture is wrong) after the bonuses. Pretty impressive.</p>\n\n\n<p>But we also wanted to show that <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/products/suse-cloud/\">our product</a> would fare well, so <a href=\"http://blog.adamspiers.org/\">Adam</a> and I started looking at this. We knew it couldn't be faster than the way Dirk picked, and from the start, we targetted the second position. For this approach, there was not much to do since this was similar to what he did in Paris, and there was work to update our SUSE OpenStack Cloud Admin appliance recently. Our first attempt failed miserably due to a nasty bug (which was actually caused by some unicode character in the ID of the USB stick we were using to install the OS... we fixed that bug later in the night). The second attempt went smoother and was actually much faster than we had anticipated: SUSE OpenStack Cloud deployed everything in 23 minutes and 17 seconds, which resulted in a final time of 10 minutes and 17 seconds after bonuses/penalties. And this was with a 10 minutes penalty due to the use of Juno (as well as a couple of minutes lost debugging some setup issue that was just mispreparation on our side). A key contributor to this result is our use of <a href=\"http://crowbar.github.io/\">Crowbar</a>, which we've kept improving over time, and that really makes it easy and fast to deploy OpenStack.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.vuntz.net/photoblog/20150525-suse-cloud-rules-the-stack.jpg\" alt=\"Wall-clock time for SUSE OpenStack Cloud\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Wall-clock time for SUSE OpenStack Cloud</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two results wouldn't have been possible without the help of <a href=\"https://github.com/toabctl\">Tom</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/rhafer\">Ralf</a>, but also without the whole SUSE OpenStack Cloud team that works on a daily basis on our product to improve it and to adapt it to the needs of our customers. We really have an awesome team (and btw, <a href=\"https://www.suse.com/company/careers/\">we're hiring</a>)!</p>\n\n\n<p>For reference, three other contestants succeeded in deploying OpenStack, with the fastest of them ending at 58 minutes after bonuses/penalties. And as I mentioned earlier, there were even more contestants (including some who are not vendors of an OpenStack distribution), which is really good to see. I hope we'll see even more in Tokyo!</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.vuntz.net/photoblog/20150525-rule-the-stack-results.jpg\" alt=\"Results of the Rule the Stack contest\" style=\"display:block; margin:0 auto;\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Results of the Rule the Stack contest</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also thanks to Intel for organizing this; I'm sure every contestant had fun and there was quite a good mood in the area reserved for the contest.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> See also the <a href=\"https://01.org/openstack/openstacksummitvancouverbc2015/rule-stack-vancouver-results\">summary of the contest</a> from the organizers.</p>",

    "contentHtml": "After working with my ambilight clone for a few days, I discovered the biggest annoyance was that it wouldn't turn off after turning off the TV. &nbsp;I had some ideas on how I could remotely trigger it from the phone or from an external HTPC but I really wanted a self contained solution in case I decided to swap the HTPC for a FireTV or a Chromecast.<br />\n<br />\nThis brought me to trying to do it directly via my remote. &nbsp;My HTPC uses a mceusb, so I was tempted to just get another mceusb for the pi. &nbsp;This would have been overkill though, the pi has tons of unused GPIO's, it can be done far simpler (and cheaper).<br />\n<br />\nI looked into it and discovered that someone actually already wrote a kernel module that directly controls an IR sensor on a GPIO. &nbsp;The kernel module is based off the existing lirc_serial module, but adapted specifically for the raspberry pi. &nbsp;(See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/\">http://aron.ws/projects/lirc_rpi/</a> for more information)<br />\n<br />\n<h3>\nHardware</h3>\nAll that's necessary is a 38 kHz IR sensor. &nbsp;You'll spend under $5 on one of them on <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00HKJ5982/ref=nosim&amp;tag=supmarworblo-20\">Amazon</a>&nbsp;(plus some shipping)&nbsp;or you can get one from radio shack if you want something quick and local. &nbsp;I spent $4.87 on one at my local radio shack.<br />\n<br />\nThe sensor is really simple, 3 pins. &nbsp;All 3 pins are available in the pi's header. &nbsp;One goes to 3.3V rail, one to ground, and one to a spare GPIO. &nbsp;There's a few places on the header that you can use for each. &nbsp;Just make sure you match up the pinout to the sensor you get. &nbsp;I chose to use GPIO 22 as it's most convenient for my lego case. &nbsp;The lirc_rpi defaults to GPIO 18.<br />\n<br />\nSome notes to keep in mind:<br />\n<br />\n<ol>\n<li>While soldering it, be cognizant of which way you want the sensor to face so that it can be accessed from the remote. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Remember that you are connecting to 3.3V and Ground from the Pi header. &nbsp;The ground connection won't be the same as your rail that was used to power the pi if you are powering via USB. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>The GPIO pins are not rated for 5V, so be sure to connect to the 3.3V.</li>\n</ol>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a

KEY_POWER2. &nbsp;If you don't have the codes available for both \"Power On\" and \"Power Off\" then you can just program \"Power Toggle\" to KEY_POWER.</div>\n<div>\n<br /></div>\n<div>\n<span

can examine that it's properly recognizing your key event using the irw command. &nbsp;Once irw is running, press the button on the remote and make sure your pi recognizes it. &nbsp;Once you're done

    "contentHtml": "<h2>\nApplication Confinement</h2>\nWhen we started thinking about how to design the security infrastructure in Ubuntu Touch, one of the important criterias was user privacy. For Ubuntu Touch, and the converged desktop in the future, we are moving from a model where people install software provided in an archive maintained by packagers to a model where applications get uploaded by the authors themselves directly into a software store. While this allows users to quickly gain access to the latest and greatest applications, it also brings with it a new problem: how to prevent malicious applications from stealing the user’s private data.<br />\n<br />\nThe traditional archive model in Ubuntu is based on trust, barrier to entry, and time. In order to get something uploaded or modified in the archive, a developer needs to demonstrate trustability by contributing a significant amount of work before upload rights are granted. Learning how to create and modify packaging, and successfully getting contributions sponsored is complex, time consuming, and is a barrier to entry. Once a package does get uploaded or modified, it is generally done in the development release. This allows a package to be in the archive for a certain amount of time before it becomes part of an official release. Hopefully, if something malicious does make it to the archive, it will be discovered in the development release before it gets published in an official release.<br />\n<br />\nThis long and complex process results in a software archive that can be trusted, but prevents software developers from being able to quickly get new versions of their software into the hands of their users. One of the goals of the Ubuntu Software Store is to allow a software developer to perform a few simple steps and have their application available to be installed by users in minutes, not in months.<br />\n<br />\nHow do we trust software that can be made available to users in minutes? Simple: we confine it, and prevent it from accessing the user’s private data.<br />\n<br />\n<h2>\nThe Permissions Problem</h2>\n<br />\nAt some point, an application may need to access some of the user’s data for it to be useful. For example, an image editing application is quite useless if it can’t open any of the user’s pictures. There needs to be a way to give applications permission to access certain data.<br />\n<br />\nOn another mobile platform, this is solved in two ways: having each application ship with a list of required permissions, and implement a shared storage location where applications can freely access the user’s files. When a user installs an application, a dialog box is displayed listing all the permissions that are required for the application to work correctly. The user then has two choices: they can either continue with the installation and grant the required permissions, or they can cancel the installation process.<br />\n<br />\nAs a user, this is a difficult choice to make.<br />\n<br />\nIn order for a user to make an informed decision about a security question, there needs to be some context. If a flashlight application I am attempting to install indicates that it requires access to my address book, I have no idea at this point in time <i>why</i> that access is required. Does the application feature a “Recommend this app to friends!” button which would require access to my contact list, or does it contain adware that wants to data mine me? At this stage, I am unable to make an informed decision on the trustworthiness of the application, and will most likely install it even if I’m not in complete agreement with the permissions that are being requested. This is an all-or-nothing proposition: there is no way for me to use an application if I don’t accept the complete list of permission it requests.<br />\n<br />\nThis results in a software store loaded with no-cost applications that exist solely to data mine personal information for profit. Users are walking around with mobile devices completely unaware of the fact that the trivial applications they’ve installed are tracking every move they make.<br />\n<br />\n<h2>\nTrusted Helpers</h2>\n<br />\nIn the security model we’ve developed, users get to make decisions on sensitive actions at the moment they are needed, instead of at application installation time. This is performed by system components called “Trusted Helpers”.<br />\n<br />\nUbuntu Software Store applications are confined by default. They can only access their own directories, and their own data. Instead of granting permissions to access user data, we grant access to <i>request</i> user data using Trusted Helpers. This allows applications to access specific data as approved by the user instead of granting permissions to access it all.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, instead of granting permission to directly access all of the user’s contact list, an application can request access to a contact. The system address book will then display a list of contacts to the user and only the specific contact selected by the user will be sent to the application. The application <i>only</i> has access to the contact which was specifically authorized by the user.<br />\n<br />\nIf a flashlight application needs access to a user contact in order for a “Recommend this app to friends!” button to work, the user will be making an informed choice, as the request will be the direct result of having pressed the button. The flashlight app can be used without fear of it accessing contact information during normal usage.<br />\n<br />\nThe same idea exists to exchange data between applications. If the user wants to edit a picture using an image editing application, the application will ask a system service known as the Content Hub to obtain an image. The Content Hub will then request a picture from the application which owns the data, in this case the Gallery application. The Gallery application will display a picker dialog to the user allowing them to select a specific photo to which the image editor will be granted access.<br />\n<br />\nA similar approach exists for access to other system services that are security-sensitive, such as the device GPS. At the moment an application wants to access the user’s location, a dialog will be displayed asking for permission. If the user accepts the request, the decision is cached, and the application can now access the user’s location in the future. If the user declines, the application can continue functioning normally, but without the location information. A user will be able to revoke the granted permissions at any time.<br />\n<br />\nTrusted Helpers allow users to specify, in a fine-grained way, which private information can be accessed by applications. The decision to grant these permissions is done at the moment the access is needed, giving the user the appropriate context for making an informed decision. Applications can be installed and used without fear that private data is being collected in the background.<br />\n<br />\n<h2>\nPolicy Groups</h2>\n<br />\nApplications in the Ubuntu Software Store are confined with technology called AppArmor. In order to facilitate the creation of AppArmor profiles by application developers, Ubuntu comes with a predefined list of “Policy Groups”. These Policy Groups are specified by application developers when creating packages for submission to the Ubuntu Software Store.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the Policy Groups simply give access to the APIs necessary to communicate with Trusted Helpers. For example, the “location” Policy Group allows an application to communicate with the location service which uses the GPS, but does not give access to the GPS directly. The location service is a Trusted Helper which will prompt the user for authorization, so the mere presence of this Policy Group doesn’t directly affect user privacy.<br />\n<br />\nSome of the other Policy Groups, such as “networking”, grant access to common services that aren’t really suitable for user prompting. Since most applications need network access, it would be inconvenient and inefficient to prompt the user for each one.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Policy Groups weren’t designed to be visible to end users, there is a utility in the Ubuntu Software Store called “Permy” that will display the ones being used by each installed application.<br />\n<br />\nPower users who would like to experiment with restricting Policy Groups for installed applications can currently do so by editing the security manifest files. Each package in the Ubuntu Software Store ships a security manifest file that enumerates the Policy Groups granted to the package. When the package is installed, its security manifest file is available in /var/lib/apparmor/clicks/ and it can be edited by the admin of the system. For example, if you wanted to remove the “networking” Policy Group from the hello-world application:<br />\n<br />\n$ adb shell vi /var/lib/apparmor/clicks/ar.com.beuno.hello-world_hello-world_0.1.json<br />\n<br />\nchange:<br />\n<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"policy_groups\": [<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"networking\"<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ],<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"policy_version\": 1.0<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\nto:<br />\n<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"policy_groups\": [],<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \"policy_version\": 1.0<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\nThen apply the changes to the AppArmor policy with:<br />\n<br />\n$ adb shell aa-clickhook -f<br />\n<br />\nAt the moment, application upgrades will reset any modifications done to Policy Groups, but we will be introducing override files in this development cycle. The override files will allow power users to revoke application Policy Groups in a way that will survive application upgrades.<br />\n<br />\nIn the future, we intend to develop the required system service to allow power users to easily revoke Policy Groups with a simple graphical interface.<br />\n<br />\n<h2>\nThe User is in Control</h2>\n<br />\nWe believe the user should ultimately be in control of all access to their private data, and security should be more fine-grained than the all-or-nothing access inherent to a set of predetermined permissions associated with an application. Allowing the user to selectively share data with applications on a use by use basis as is done with Trusted Helpers makes Ubuntu Touch and the Ubuntu Software Store the ideal platform for privacy conscious users.",

The file system on which the content lived has a bullet hole of 8 GB in it, which was helpfully discarded by pvmove. It's pretty unhappy about that fact, parts of the git repository are unusable and directories cannot be accessed anymore. git-annex cannot possibly run anymore.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, I was still able to access the git-annex branch within said git repository (using porcelain). This branch contains a file called <span style=\"font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;\">remote.log</span> which contains the keys of the special remotes. There's one per remote, encrypted to a GPG key of your choice and all files within that remote are encrypted with the same symmetric key.<br />\n<br />\nOne small detail stopped me from getting the decryption right the first time, though. It seems that git-annex uses randomness generated by GPG and armored into base64. In my naïveté I spotted the base64 and decoded it. Instead it's used verbatim: the first 256 bytes as HMAC key (which reduces randomness to 192 bytes) and the remaining bytes for the symmetric key used by GPG (which will do another key derivation for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAST-128\">CAST5</a> with it). A <a href=\"http://git-annex.branchable.com/bugs/encryption_key_is_surprising/\">bug about that</a> just hit the git-annex wiki.<br />\n<br />\nWith that knowledge in mind I wrote <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/pkern/5078559\">a little tool</a> that's able to generate encrypted content keys from the plain ones used in the symlinks. That helps you to locate the file in the encrypted remote. Fetch it and then use the tool to decrypt the file in question with the right key.<br />\n<br />\nThe lesson: Really backup the git repository used with git-annex and especially remote.log. I'm now missing most of the metadata but for some more important files it's luckily still present. Recovery of the file content does not depend on it if you can deduce the filename from the content. If you have many little files it might be a bit futile without it, though.",

Also, it was confirmed that there will be no RC official images, but a period when images will be declared as “release candidate”.</p>\n<p>Also, the status of derivatives was discussed. Finally, something was written about the status of derivatives, how you can achieve this status, what support is provided by Canonical &#8230; It was something always blurry, and we suffer it when Lubuntu tried to be official.</p>\n<p>See details on :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedDerivatives\">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedDerivatives</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The plenaries was about ARM technology and patents.

It may have problems with multitouch support which is now included in GTK. It may conflict with Ubuntu multitouch implementation. There was also a discussion about the idea to have some sort of LTS version for GTK (discussion to be continued with GNOME people).</p>\n<p>The plan for the rest of the applications is to stay by default on 3.2, and pickup components from 3.4 in some cases. Nautilus (and gvfs), Evolution for example should stay with 3.2, like empathy. For other small applications, it will be discuss case by case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Default Apps Discussion</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-default-apps\">https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-p-default-apps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-p/meeting/19442/desktop-p-default-apps/\">http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-p/meeting/19442/desktop-p-default-apps/</a></p>\n<p>This is the usual session to discuss applications by default. Many topics was discussed :</p>\n<p>&#8211; Inclusion of Boot-repair in the Live-CD : probably yes if there is no stopper.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Inclusion of FreeRDP : to be check with security.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Video editor : No (not needed by default)</p>\n<p>&#8211; Rhythmbox / Banshee :</p>\n<p>This subject was a bit of surprise for me, I didn’t expect such discussion will happen. However, the 2 applications have problems :</p>\n<p>&#8211; Banshee : Problem on ARM (doesn’t work), no GTK3 support, and removing Banshee will remove Mono from the CD (good for the space) and probably from main (which make Security team happy, not having to maintain Mono stack for 5 years)</p>\n<p>&#8211; RB : U1 store need to be updated, Music lense needs to be updated, it needs a release from upstream.</p>\n<p>A quick vote on usage of both applications in the room makes approximately a 50 / 50 result (maybe a bit more for RB).</p>\n<p>Conclusion, RB will probably be back on the CD, if no problem is raised by the other teams not present during the session. The decision was not easy, but IMO it makes sense in the context of an LTS. And, well, Banshee will still be available in the archive, will at least the same level of integration than in 11.10.</p>\n</div>",

This was the first meeting of this new community, and we had many things on our agenda: the organization of the team, the team logo/branding, the overall team goals and purpose, our long term goals and the goals for the Oneiric cycle. Although we discussed many topics, we didn&#8217;t manage to talk about everything we originally planned.<br />\n<span id=\"more-19\"></span><br />\nWe started the discussion with stating our team vision. Our goal is to help power users to get the most out of Ubuntu. We want to provide a place for power users to communicate, document configuration functionality, and provide tools for tweaking the system. Basically, we want to give users the power to expand, adjust, and tweak their system. To achieve these goals we want to create documentation of tweaks and useful tools, with a mind toward safety. We don&#8217;t want to suggest tweaks that could cause issues for a user and can not be backed out of.</p>\n<p>We talked about what actions can be done in this cycle. A very important part of our mission is to build the <a title=\"Building The Kitchen Sink\" href=\"http://www.jonobacon.org/2011/05/19/building-the-kitchen-sink/\">Kitchen Sink</a>: a single application that supports multiple plug-in that provides you with a plethora of check-boxes for switching on and off all kinds of different things. This application will most probably be the well known <a title=\"Ubuntu Tweak\" href=\"http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\">Ubuntu Tweak</a>. The developer of Ubuntu Tweak, Tualatrix Chou has already joined our mailing list.</p>\n<p>The Ubuntu Power User Community will focus on making Ubuntu Tweak ready for Oneiric, and push it into the repositories. The next version of Ubuntu Tweak will have a plugin feature, so the problematic PPA part of the program can be a separate install in the next version. First, we need to focus on getting the code in shape. According to Jordan Mantha (LaserJock), it needs some analysis for safety and stability. A plugin for Unity specific settings has to be made. The packaging will fall into place pretty easily once these are done.</p>\n<p>An important part of our mission is creating documentation for Unity about topics like keyboard shortcuts, what options exist in CompizConfig Settings Manager and dconf-editor, and what they actually do. We already have a lot of information on <a title=\"Ask Ubuntu\" href=\"http://askubuntu.com\">Ask Ubuntu</a>, so it can serve as a good starting point. The main problem is that Ask Ubuntu is not a documentation source. Our goal is to create high quality documentation for Power Users based on the information available on Ask Ubuntu and from other sources.</p>\n<p>The first meeting of the Ubuntu Power User Community was a very important milestone in the life of the project. We set some ambitious but not unreachable goals for us. If you want to get involved in the Power User Community just subscribe to the <a title=\"ubuntu-power-users\" href=\"https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-power-users\">mailing list</a> list or join the <a title=\"Ubuntu Power Users\" href=\"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu-power-users\">#ubuntu-power-users</a> IRC channel on Freenode. There is a plenty of room for you to share your power with others.</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>Recently the General Director for Education of <a title=\"La escuela andaluza usa un software que abandonamos hace diez años\" href=\"http://www.elcorreoweb.es/andalucia/092563/escuela/andaluza/software/abandonamos/diez/anos\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft took off his mask</a> arguing in a interview that here, in Andalusia, we are using software that Microsoft left ten years ago.</p>\n<p>Here in Andalusia, at the south of Spain, every computer (400.000+) at the schools runs «software libre» thanks to the commitment made by the regional government 7 years ago. Specifically, we run Guadalinex Edu, a base of Ubuntu with a lot of free educational applications in the top.</p>\n<p>During the interview you can read in spanish somethings like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Journalist</strong>: «Andalusia has introduced free software in schools and has left out Microsoft &#8230;»</li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: «There are few communities that have implemented only free software, Andalusia is one. Free software is not sustainable by the model itself. We invest 9500 million annually in research and development and the results are the products we put on the market. We know what it takes to make an operating system and it&#8217;s a lot of money. The software is free of charge but who is paying this price? Because we have to pay someone to operate and maintain, and these costs are more expensive than ours. This is obvious because there are other interests behind. Free software is built with subsidies and you can&#8217;t do subsidies to be the engine that supports a model of technological innovation in the school.»</li>\n<li><strong>Journalist</strong>: «Guadalinex is similar  enough to Windows, right?»</li>\n<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: «Well, if  you look in Windows 7, it does not  look like Guadalinex at all. Sometimes, we make the mistake of comparing the latest versions of  these operating systems with Microsoft products launched back in 2000. You say that the  software used by schools in Andalusia is similar to XP, fine, but  Windows XP is that it launched a decade ago. We left it 10 years ago and the world has changed. And if you keep  Windows XP is due to a poor idea: Is it enough with what I have? Depends on the  needs and if you want to give our kids the best or not.»</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the new version of Guadalinex Edu based on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx our students and teachers can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> interact with each other thanks to <a title=\"Guadalinex Edu collaboration tool (codename sigala)\" href=\"https://launchpad.net/guadalinexedu-collaboration-tool\" target=\"_blank\">new collaboration tool</a> in a simple  way.</li>\n<li>install a lot of software previously tested doing a single click  through the software center.</li>\n<li>make a backup of all their personal files in a usb stick and recover it later doing a single  click.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>all of then installed and ready for use in less than 30 minutes through the network or usb device.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, every people of the educational community can obtain professional support by phone for free of charge through the <a title=\"CGA\" href=\"http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/cga/\" target=\"_blank\">Advanced Center for ICT Schools Management</a> who is in charge of the maintenance of the whole network. How many of these services offer Microsoft?</p>\n<p>I would like to recommend this person of Microsoft to have a look at the new version  of <a title=\"guadalinexedu.org\" href=\"http://www.guadalinexedu.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Guadalinex Edu</a> (available in few days) and then ask him what do they think is the best for  kids? Perhaps  motivation, enthusiasm and hard work of the entire free software  community can exceed 9.5 billion invested by Microsoft. Don&#8217;t worry about kids, you must be worried about <a title=\"Ubuntu bug #1\" href=\"https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1\" target=\"_blank\">the day</a> when these children reach the professional market and the quality and freedom of the free software used at schools will have more weight than all the investment you are doing in your proprietary software.</p>\n<p>:wq</p>",

Auch wenn ich meinen <a title=\"Openmoko Freerunner\" href=\"http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner/de\" target=\"_blank\">Freerunner</a> sehr mag, auf mein neues Spielzeug ist einfach mehr Verlass. Da mein altes Handy einem Wasserschaden (kein Kommentar) zum Opfer fiel, besorgte ich mir ein <a title=\"HTC Hero\" href=\"http://www.htc.com/de/product.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">HTC Hero</a> mit <a title=\"Google Android\" href=\"http://www.google.ch/intl/de_ch/mobile/android/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Android</a>. Ein <a title=\"Apple iPhone\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/de/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone</a> wollte ich nicht und ich bereue es bis heute nicht. Mein kleiner Held ist nicht nur die Hälfte so teuer, sondern bringt auch alles mit was ich brauche.</p>\n<p>Nun aber zum Wesentlichen. Etwas vom dümmsten an Handys war bislang die Portierung der Kontakte auf das neue Gerät. Umso erfreuter war ich, dass es dieses Mal sehr einfach ging. Da Android nun mal von Google kommt, unterstützt es natürlich auch Synchronisation mit dem Kalender, den Mails und den Kontakten von Google. Wenn man mal die Bedenken bezüglich der &#8222;Datenkrake&#8220; Google aussen vor lässt und sich auf die funktionellen Fakten bezieht, dann ist das mehr als nur optimal. Angenommen man benutzt bereits die genannten Google Dienste bereits, muss man auf dem Android lediglich seine Kontodaten angeben und alles regelt sich von selbst.</p>\n<p>Wie einige von euch wahrscheinlich wissen, bin ich Teilhaber von <a title=\"uSystems GmbH\" href=\"http://www.usystems.ch/\" target=\"_blank\">uSystems GmbH</a>, die unter anderem eine <a title=\"webling.ch - verwaltet deinen Verein\" href=\"http://www.webling.ch\" target=\"_blank\">Vereinsverwaltungssoftware</a> entwickelt. Die nennt sich Webling und kann eigentlich viel mehr, aber in diesem Beispiel brauche ich sie nur als Adressverwaltung. Denn seit einiger Zeit habe ich mir eine persönliche Instanz davon unter den Nagel gerissen und brauche es um die Kontaktdaten meiner Freunde zu verwalten. So habe ich einen zentralen Ort, wo ich von überall darauf Zugriff habe. Warum ich das erwähne? Nun Webling kann Daten nicht nur Importieren, sondern auch in diversen Formaten exportieren. Hier zeigt sich wieder mal, dass gewisse simple und bereits recht alte Standards auch heute noch immer super sind. Denn Webling bietet unter anderem die Möglichkeit in eine <a title=\"CSV Dateiformat auf Wikipedia DE\" href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSV_%28Dateiformat%29\" target=\"_blank\">CSV-Datei</a> zu exportieren und Google wiederum diese zu importieren. Und da die Google Kontakte ja mit meinem Handy synchronisiert werden, habe ich nun sofort alle meine Kontakte auch auf meinem Handy. Und sollte ich mal einen neuen Kontakt nicht importiert haben, so kann ich jederzeit von überall über den <a title=\"Webling.ch - News\" href=\"http://www.webling.ch/news.php\" target=\"_blank\">neuen</a> Webling Mobile Client auch per Handy auf alle Daten zugreifen. Sehr praktisch sag ich da nur!  <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> (Auch wenn ich natürlich etwas voreingenommen bin.)</p>",

    "contentHtml": "<p>I&#8217;m in Barcelona to attend the Ubuntu Developer Summit for Karmic Koala, thanks to the kind sponsorship of Canonical, and I thought I&#8217;d use the last bit of  energy I have left from the first day to post short summaries of the sessions I attended.</p>\n<h3>Increasing Apport Coverage</h3>\n<p>This QA session was about increasing the coverage of the <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport\">Apport</a> automated bug reporting tool. One obvious way to do this will be to increase the amount of <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport#Apport%20Hooks%20available\">packages with Apport package hooks</a>, so the QA team will lead a drive to do exactly that. The target will be to make sure that packages to which a sampling (likely by a 50% reduction) of the last 1000 bugs  filed belong have hooks by the next release. The #1 blocker leading to the current situation where we have few packages with hooks was identified to be the fact that few people know that the feature exists at all or is useful to the extent that it actually is. Assuming that there&#8217;s a free time slot, a plenary tutorial will be held about this in an effort to remind attending developers and QA people of this relatively simple yet rather important task.</p>\n<h3>Design and Usability Clinic</h3>\n<p>This was a hands-on session where the Canonical Design and User Experience Team offered aid to people who needed design/UX advice for their projects in a &#8220;clinic&#8221; setting. After about quarter an hour of introductions and roundtable talk, the attendees divided up into several groups discussing usability issues in their respective projects. A nice and apparently improvised byproduct was the permanent &#8220;UX Clinic&#8221; table that got set up in the lounge, around which similar discussions went on intermittently in the rest of the day.</p>\n<h3>Specialization Within Bug Control</h3>\n<p>Having more specialist members on the Ubuntu Bug Control team has been a recurring wish. This session focused on the new mentoring program aimed at getting more specialist (and otherwise) people from the Bug Squad into the Bug Control team. Christophe Sauthier and Emmet Hikory from the MOTU team were present to share their experiences with the mentoring model at length, which was beneficial.</p>\n<h3>Meet Your Users</h3>\n<p>This design/UX session revolved around (I choose the term advisedly) the theme of &#8220;personas&#8221;, that is, hypothetical audience stereotypes whom Ubuntu should be designed for. The premise Ivanka Majic, the session lead, put forward was that basing design decisions on the requirements of the more &#8220;peripheral&#8221; users in terms of association and attachment to Ubuntu and free software would both cover various specialist bases, and ensure that the more central area which has requirements that are more homogeneous and already better catered for would be covered as well.</p>\n<p>Attendees suggested various stereotypes along the lines of  &#8220;students&#8221;, &#8220;children&#8221;, &#8220;administrators&#8221; and &#8220;media producers&#8221; on post-it notes, part of which were later evaluated on scales according to criteria such as age, social status, influence level, cultural background, so on.</p>\n<p>My only gripe with this session was paradoxically also the major highlight of it: the talk seemed to stay hung up in the air, with no real conclusion or points to act from (the Gobby server failing and the consequent lack of collective notes certainly didn&#8217;t help). Of course this was the start of what we hopefully all expect to be a long conversation; the abrupt interruption of time running out only underlined the hunger I felt, and felt that others also felt, for more in-depth discussion of the audience factor in free software design and usability, and that in itself is promising, given that it&#8217;s actually gaining traction in Ubuntu now. Had <a href=\"http://troy-sobotka.blogspot.com/\">Troy Sobotka</a>, who has been an outspoken, if unforgiving, proponent of audience-aligned design in free software attended, he might have burst into tears of joy.</p>\n<h3>Finding Tasks For New Developers</h3>\n<p>Daniel Holbach this session, which focused on coming up with new means of offering &#8220;bitesize&#8221; work to new contributors to Ubuntu, mainly in the development area, which would further lower the barriers of entry and attract different sets of would-be contributors.</p>",
